Fu Yu's operating performance over the last 24 months, particularly in FY2024, demonstrates a significant positive shift driven by a revitalized core manufacturing segment, which is experiencing a turnaround for the first time in over a decade [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5]. This improvement is underpinned by three critical operating metrics: robust manufacturing revenue growth and a favorable geographic shift, substantial expansion in manufacturing gross profit margins, and a strong pipeline of new project acquisitions and a growing order book. While the overall Group revenue saw only a modest increase due to a declining supply chain management services segment, the core manufacturing business shows clear signs of operational leverage and strategic expansion into higher-value sectors.

Here are the three most important operating metrics:

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue Growth and Geographic Mix

*   **Definition and Relevance:** This metric measures the year-over-year percentage increase in revenue specifically from the Group's core manufacturing operations and how the contribution from different geographic segments (Singapore, Malaysia, China) is changing. It is a key indicator of volume growth, demand for the core products, and shifts in regional market performance, which directly impacts overall top-line expansion and strategic market share.
*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - FY2023 to FY2024):**
    *   **FY2024:** Revenue from continuing operations (manufacturing) grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million in FY2024 from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5]. This represents the first sharp improvement in more than a decade for the core manufacturing segment [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5].
    *   **Geographic Contribution:**
        *   Singapore operations: Sales improved 20.9% to S$46.2 million in FY2024 from S$38.2 million in FY2023. Its percentage contribution to total manufacturing sales grew to 40.2% in FY2024, compared to 36.8% in FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9].
        *   Malaysia operations: Revenue improved 24.9% to S$36.6 million in FY2024 from S$29.3 million in FY2023. Contribution increased to 31.9% in FY2024 from FY2023's 28.2% [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9].
        *   China operations: Revenue declined 11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024 compared to S$36.4 million in FY2023. Contribution accounted for 27.9% of total manufacturing sales in FY2024 (FY2023: 35.0%) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9].
    *   **1H2024 Data:** Manufacturing revenue rose to S$54.8 million (1H2023: S$52.6 million) [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 5]. This was driven by Singapore manufacturing revenue of S$21.0 million (1H2023: S$19.7 million) and Malaysia manufacturing revenue of S$17.8 million (1H2023: S$12.8 million), while China's manufacturing revenue was S$16.0 million (1H2023: S$20.1 million) [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 5].
*   **Benchmarking:** While direct competitor or industry average data for manufacturing revenue growth is not provided in the extracted facts, the Company explicitly notes this is the first sharp improvement in over a decade [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5], suggesting significant internal outperformance relative to its own historical trends.
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The higher topline in FY2024 was primarily due to higher order volumes from existing customers and new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5]. The robust growth in Singapore and Malaysia operations (over 20% each) successfully offset the decline in China operations, indicating a successful strategic pivot towards more buoyant regional markets or internal capabilities in those regions [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9]. This shift highlights a proactive management approach to adapting to market demands and regional strengths.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend of strong growth in Singapore and Malaysia manufacturing segments appears sustainable, supported by new project acquisitions in high-growth areas like biomedical [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 11]. However, the continued decline in China operations (LBT of S$4.3 million in FY2024 compared to S$3.8 million in FY2023) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9] could be a drag if not addressed. The overall 20% increase in the order book at the end of FY2024 further supports future growth sustainability [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6].
*   **Financial Impact:** The 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue directly contributed to the Group's overall revenue increase of 0.5% in FY2024 (despite a significant decline in the supply chain management services segment revenue) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8]. This growth was a primary factor behind the substantial improvement in gross profit and the sharp narrowing of the net loss from continuing operations [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5].
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What specific initiatives or market conditions drove the significant growth and increased contribution of Singapore and Malaysia manufacturing revenues, and how are these being leveraged for sustained expansion in these regions?
    2.  What are the root causes for the revenue decline and worsening loss before tax in China operations, and what detailed strategies are in place to either mitigate further decline or enhance profitability in that market?

### 2. Manufacturing Segment Gross Profit Margin

*   **Definition and Relevance:** This metric measures the profitability of the Group's core manufacturing operations at the gross profit level, indicating the efficiency of production, cost management, and pricing strategies. It directly reflects the unit margin achieved on manufactured goods and is crucial for overall profitability and cash flow generation.
*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - FY2023 to FY2024):**
    *   **FY2024:** Manufacturing segment gross profit margin improved to 13.5% from 11.7% in FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8].
    *   **Overall Group Gross Profit Margin:** Increased to 8.9% in FY2024 compared to 7.0% in FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8].
    *   **1H2024 Data:** The Group's Gross Profit Margin (GPM) stood at 6.7% (1H2023: 9.0%) due to a change in revenue mix [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 6]. (Specific manufacturing GPM for 1H2024 is not separately provided).
    *   **2H2024 Data:** The Group's gross profit margin in 2H24 was 13.2% compared to 5.8% in 2H23 [SOURCE: Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, page 30].
*   **Benchmarking:** No direct competitor or industry average gross profit margin data is provided. However, the 1.8 percentage point improvement in manufacturing GPM in a single year (13.5% vs 11.7%) is a significant internal achievement, highlighting enhanced operational efficiency and/or favorable product mix [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8].
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The improvement in manufacturing GPM is likely attributable to a combination of factors, including higher order volumes leading to better economies of scale, improved operational efficiency, and a more favorable product mix, especially from new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5]. The fluctuating Group GPM across halves (dip in 1H2024, strong recovery in 2H2024) indicates the significant impact of the lower-margin supply chain management services segment on the blended Group margin, especially when its revenue soared in 1H2024 [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 6]. The strong 2H2024 GPM suggests that either manufacturing margins improved further, or the revenue mix heavily shifted towards the higher-margin manufacturing segment as supply chain management services revenue declined sharply in 2H2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, page 30].
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The sustainability of improved manufacturing GPM depends on maintaining efficiency gains, continued focus on higher-value products, and managing input costs effectively. The strategic focus on and success in securing new projects in biomedical and drug delivery devices likely supports continued margin expansion, as these segments typically command higher margins [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 11].
*   **Financial Impact:** The 1.8 percentage point increase in manufacturing GPM directly contributed to the 28.1% increase in manufacturing gross profit to S$15.5 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8]. This margin expansion was a crucial factor for the substantial increase in EBITDA (more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million) and the sharp narrowing of the net loss from continuing operations to S$1.2 million from S$7.6 million [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5].
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What specific operational improvements, cost reduction initiatives, or changes in product mix (e.g., higher-margin biomedical projects) primarily drove the 1.8 percentage point improvement in manufacturing gross profit margin in FY2024?
    2.  Given the significant fluctuation in Group GPM between 1H2024 (6.7%) and 2H2024 (13.2%), what were the key drivers behind the 1H dip and the strong 2H recovery, particularly regarding the interplay between manufacturing and supply chain management segment margins and revenue mix?

### 3. New Project Acquisition & Order Book Growth

*   **Definition and Relevance:** This metric assesses the Company's ability to secure new contracts and expand its future revenue pipeline, indicated by new project wins and the growth of its overall order book. It is a crucial forward-looking indicator of future volumes, customer acquisition success, and potential market share gains, especially in targeted growth sectors like biomedical and medical devices.
*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - FY2023 to FY2024):**
    *   **FY2024 End:** The Group's order book increased 20% year-on-year [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6].
    *   **FY2024 Drivers:** Higher topline was due to higher order volumes from existing customers and new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5].
    *   **1H2024 Specific Wins:**
        *   Secured a project with an international biomedical company to produce microfluidic chips [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 11].
        *   Signed a partnership with a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation (CDMO) to produce high-precision tools for drug delivery devices [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 11].
        *   Signed an MoU in 1Q2024 to be the exclusive plastics supplier for a local medical device manufacturer [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 11].
*   **Benchmarking:** No specific competitor data for order book growth or new project wins is provided. However, the successful securing of new projects in the "biomedical" sector is a strong positive signal as it's typically a high-growth, high-value industry, suggesting strategic success in diversifying and moving up the value chain.
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The 20% order book growth is a direct result of the Group's success in securing new projects and increased demand from existing customers [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6, 5]. The explicit mention of new projects in the biomedical and consumer segments indicates a strategic focus and successful execution in expanding into new, potentially higher-margin and stable verticals. This diversification reduces reliance on traditional segments. The capital expenditure of S$6.94 million in FY2024, mainly for factory equipment, plant, and machinery, including S$3.9 million in 1H2024 for new machineries in Singapore, likely supports the capacity and capabilities required for these new high-precision projects [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9; Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 4, 9].
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend appears sustainable given the strategic focus on securing new projects in growing sectors (biomedical/medical devices) and the stated expectation for business momentum to grow in 2H2024 due to higher order volumes and new project inquiries [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 11, 13]. The increased order book provides good visibility for future revenue and reflects sustained demand.
*   **Financial Impact:** The 20% increase in the order book directly provides revenue visibility and underpins the expected future growth in manufacturing revenue. The new projects in biomedical are likely contributing to the improved gross profit margins due to their higher value nature, thereby enhancing overall profitability and contributing to the significant EBITDA increase and narrowed net loss [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, 6].
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What is the expected revenue realization timeline and associated gross profit margin profile for the significant new projects secured in the biomedical and medical device segments, and how do these projects compare to the existing manufacturing portfolio?
    2.  What is the current breakdown of the order book by major customer segment (e.g., biomedical, consumer, other existing customers), and what proportion of future revenue growth is expected to come from new versus existing customers?
