<h1>Section 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance</h1>

<p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Company") demonstrated improved operating performance over the past 24 months, particularly in its core manufacturing segment. While overall revenue growth was modest, a significant improvement in gross profit margin, driven by increased order volumes from existing customers and new project wins in high-margin segments (biomedical and consumer), points to a positive operational trajectory.  However, the recent cessation of activities in the supply chain management segment requires further investigation. This analysis focuses on three key operating metrics: unit pricing, customer acquisition cost ("CAC"), and customer churn/retention, to assess the sustainability of this improved performance and identify potential risks and opportunities for a prospective buyer.  The analysis below is based on data extracted from Fu Yu's 2023 and 2024 financial statements (specifically [insert precise page numbers and line items here]), and requires further verification and potentially additional supporting documentation.</p>

<h2>1. Unit Pricing</h2>

<h3>Definition and Relevance:</h3>
<p>Unit pricing represents the average revenue generated per unit of product sold. This metric is crucial in assessing Fu Yu's pricing power, its ability to pass on increased costs, and its overall profitability. Higher unit pricing indicates a stronger market position and potentially better margins.</p>

<h3>Historical Data (FY2023 & FY2024):</h3>
<p>The following data requires verification and may be subject to revision upon review of the complete financial statements.  All figures are in Singapore Dollars (S$).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>FY2023:</b> S$[Insert Value] per unit (Source: Fu Yu 2023 Financial Statements, Page [Insert Page Number], Line Item [Insert Line Item])</li>
  <li><b>FY2024:</b> S$[Insert Value] per unit (Source: Fu Yu 2024 Financial Statements, Page [Insert Page Number], Line Item [Insert Line Item])</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benchmarking:</h3>
<p>Fu Yu's unit pricing will be benchmarked against [Insert Names] and industry averages derived from [Insert Source(s) of Industry Data].  This comparison will determine Fu Yu's competitive positioning and pricing strategy effectiveness. For example, "Fu Yu's unit pricing of S$[Insert Value] is [Insert Percentage]% higher/lower than the industry average of S$[Insert Value]."</p>

<h3>Performance Drivers:</h3>
<p>The change in unit pricing between FY2023 and FY2024 will be analyzed, considering factors like changes in product mix, successful price increases, and changes in raw material costs. The impact of each driver on unit price will be quantified.</p>

<h3>Sustainability of Trend:</h3>
<p>The sustainability of the observed trend in unit pricing will be assessed. Factors that could positively or negatively affect future unit pricing (e.g., competitive pressures, technological advancements, input cost inflation, demand fluctuations) will be identified.</p>

<h3>Financial Impact:</h3>
<p>The contribution of the unit price change to revenue growth and gross profit margin expansion will be quantified.  For example, "The increase in unit pricing from S$[Insert Value] to S$[Insert Value] contributed S$[Insert Value] to revenue growth and expanded the gross profit margin by [Insert Percentage]%."</p>

<h3>Due Diligence Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What is the detailed breakdown of unit pricing across different product categories and customer segments for the last 24 months, including volume-weighted average prices?</li>
  <li>What is Fu Yu's pricing strategy, and how has it adapted to changing market conditions and competitive pressures over the past two years?</li>
</ol>


<h2>2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h2>

<h3>Definition and Relevance:</h3>
<p>CAC measures the average cost incurred to acquire a new customer. A lower CAC is indicative of efficient marketing and sales processes and improved business profitability.</p>

<h3>Historical Data (FY2023 & FY2024):</h3>
<p>The following data requires verification and may be subject to revision upon review of the complete financial statements. All figures are in Singapore Dollars (S$).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>FY2023:</b> S$[Insert Value] per customer (Source: Fu Yu 2023 Financial Statements, Page [Insert Page Number], Line Item [Insert Line Item])</li>
  <li><b>FY2024:</b> S$[Insert Value] per customer (Source: Fu Yu 2024 Financial Statements, Page [Insert Page Number], Line Item [Insert Line Item])</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benchmarking:</h3>
<p>Fu Yu's CAC will be benchmarked against [Insert Names] and industry averages derived from [Insert Source(s) of Industry Data]. This comparison will quantify any outperformance or underperformance. For example, "Fu Yu's CAC of S$[Insert Value] is [Insert Percentage]% higher/lower than the industry average of S$[Insert Value]."</p>

<h3>Performance Drivers:</h3>
<p>Changes in CAC between FY2023 and FY2024 will be analyzed, considering factors such as marketing campaign effectiveness, changes in sales channels, sales force productivity, and changes in the overall competitive landscape. The impact of each driver will be quantified.</p>

<h3>Sustainability of Trend:</h3>
<p>The sustainability of the observed trend in CAC will be evaluated. Potential factors that could influence future CAC (e.g., changes in marketing strategy, competitive actions, increased customer acquisition competition) will be identified.</p>

<h3>Financial Impact:</h3>
<p>The impact of CAC changes on profitability will be quantified. For example, "A reduction in CAC from S$[Insert Value] to S$[Insert Value] improved profitability by S$[Insert Value]."</p>

<h3>Due Diligence Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Can you provide a detailed breakdown of CAC by marketing channel and customer segment for the past 24 months?</li>
  <li>What is Fu Yu's customer lifetime value (CLTV) and the CLTV/CAC ratio, and how has this changed over time?</li>
</ol>


<h2>3. Customer Churn/Retention</h2>

<h3>Definition and Relevance:</h3>
<p>Customer churn rate indicates the percentage of customers lost during a specific period. The customer retention rate represents the percentage of customers who continue their business relationship with the company. Lower churn and higher retention reflect customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to predictable revenue streams.</p>

<h3>Historical Data (FY2023 & FY2024):</h3>
<p>The following data requires verification and may be subject to revision upon review of the complete financial statements and CRM data.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>FY2023:</b> Churn rate [Insert Value]%, Retention rate [Insert Value]% (Source: Fu Yu 2023 Financial Statements & CRM Data, [Insert Source Details])</li>
  <li><b>FY2024:</b> Churn rate [Insert Value]%, Retention rate [Insert Value]% (Source: Fu Yu 2024 Financial Statements & CRM Data, [Insert Source Details])</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benchmarking:</h3>
<p>Fu Yu's churn and retention rates will be compared to those of [Insert Names] and industry benchmarks. This comparison will quantify any outperformance or underperformance. For example, "Fu Yu's churn rate of [Insert Value]% is [Insert Percentage]% lower/higher than [Competitor Name]'s churn rate of [Insert Value]%."</p>

<h3>Performance Drivers:</h3>
<p>Factors driving changes in churn and retention rates between FY2023 and FY2024 will be identified. Customer service improvements, product quality, pricing changes, and competitive pressures will be considered. The impact of each driver will be quantified.</p>

<h3>Sustainability of Trend:</h3>
<p>The sustainability of the observed trends in churn and retention will be analyzed. Factors that could cause improvement or deterioration (e.g., changes in product offerings, customer service quality, competitive intensity) will be identified.</p>

<h3>Financial Impact:</h3>
<p>The impact of changes in churn/retention on revenue and profitability will be quantified. For example, "Improved customer retention contributed S$[Insert Value] to revenue growth and increased profitability by [Insert Percentage]%."</p>

<h3>Due Diligence Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What are the key drivers of customer churn, and what initiatives has Fu Yu implemented to address these issues?</li>
  <li>What is the average customer lifetime value (CLTV) for Fu Yu, and what are the assumptions underlying this calculation?</li>
</ol>
