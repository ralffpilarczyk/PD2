# ProfileDash 2.0 Algorithm Revision Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines proposed revisions to the ProfileDash 2.0 company profile generation algorithm, focusing on improving quality, consistency, and analytical depth while maintaining efficiency.

## Current Algorithm Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between core analysis, memory, and generation
2. **4-Step Pipeline**: Progressive refinement (draft → completeness → insights → polish)
3. **Learning System**: Section-based memory with quality scoring
4. **Parallel Processing**: ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent section analysis
5. **Temperature Variation**: Different temps for different cognitive phases

### Identified Issues
1. **2-Step Reduction**: Currently reduced to just draft + polish, skipping completeness and insight critiques
2. **Word Limit Enforcement**: Aggressive cuts may lose important data
3. **LLM Quality Score Inflation**: Models tend to give overly generous quality scores
4. **Footnote Management**: Sequential numbering issues across sections
5. **Learning Extraction**: Currently happens after polish, may miss insights from intermediate steps

## Proposed Revisions

### 1. Enhanced Pipeline Architecture

#### A. Restore Full 4-Step Pipeline with Refinements
```
Step 1: Initial Draft (1000 words, variable temp)
    ↓
Step 2: Data Completeness Check (no word limit, temp 0.2)
    ↓
Step 3: Insight Enhancement (700 words, temp 0.9)
    ↓
Step 4: Professional Polish (500 words, temp 0.6)
    ↓
Step 5: Learning Extraction (from all steps)
```

#### B. Introduce Validation Gates
- After each step, validate output quality before proceeding
- Implement automatic retry with different prompts if quality threshold not met
- Track validation metrics for continuous improvement

### 2. Improved Prompt Engineering

#### A. Role-Based Prompting
- Step 1: "Data Extraction Specialist" - focus on comprehensive data gathering
- Step 2: "Completeness Auditor" - identify missing critical information
- Step 3: "Strategic Analyst" - derive non-obvious insights
- Step 4: "Executive Editor" - polish for clarity and impact

#### B. Section-Specific Temperature Tuning
```python
SECTION_TEMPERATURES = {
    "financial": {"draft": 0.4, "complete": 0.2, "insight": 0.7, "polish": 0.5},
    "strategic": {"draft": 0.6, "complete": 0.3, "insight": 0.9, "polish": 0.6},
    "operational": {"draft": 0.5, "complete": 0.2, "insight": 0.8, "polish": 0.5},
    "governance": {"draft": 0.3, "complete": 0.2, "insight": 0.6, "polish": 0.4}
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Memory System

#### A. Multi-Level Insight Storage
```python
insights = {
    "tactical": [],     # Specific data extraction patterns
    "analytical": [],   # Analysis techniques that work
    "strategic": [],    # High-level insights
    "warnings": []      # Common pitfalls to avoid
}
```

#### B. Cross-Section Learning
- Identify patterns that apply across multiple sections
- Build company-specific insights during analysis
- Create industry-specific pattern libraries

### 4. Quality Control Mechanisms

#### A. Objective Quality Metrics
- Data density score (facts per 100 words)
- Citation coverage (% of claims with sources)
- Insight novelty score (using embedding similarity)
- Structural compliance (tables, formatting, etc.)

#### B. Adversarial Validation
```python
def validate_section(section_output):
    # Use a separate prompt to critically evaluate the output
    validation_prompt = f"""
    You are a harsh critic. Find flaws in this analysis:
    1. Missing critical data points
    2. Unsupported claims
    3. Generic insights
    4. Formatting issues
    
    Score 1-10 where 10 means flawless.
    Be extremely critical.
    """
```

### 5. Advanced Features

#### A. Dynamic Section Prioritization
- Analyze document content to identify information-rich sections
- Allocate more processing time to complex sections
- Skip or simplify sections with minimal data

#### B. Cross-Reference Engine
```python
def build_cross_references(all_sections):
    # Identify connections between sections
    # Flag contradictions
    # Build unified narrative threads
```

#### C. Real-Time Adaptation
- Monitor API response quality
- Adjust prompts based on model behavior
- Implement fallback strategies for degraded performance

### 6. Output Enhancement

#### A. Structured Data Layer
```python
structured_output = {
    "raw_data": {},          # All extracted numbers/facts
    "derived_metrics": {},    # Calculated ratios/trends
    "key_insights": [],       # Top findings
    "risk_factors": [],       # Identified concerns
    "data_gaps": []          # Missing information
}
```

#### B. Interactive Elements
- Expandable sections for detailed data
- Hover tooltips for metric definitions
- Dynamic charts for trend visualization

### 7. Performance Optimization

#### A. Intelligent Caching
- Cache document parsing results
- Store intermediate analysis steps
- Reuse common calculations

#### B. Adaptive Parallelization
```python
def determine_worker_count(document_complexity, section_count):
    # Start conservative
    base_workers = 2
    
    # Adjust based on complexity
    if document_complexity > 0.8:
        return base_workers
    elif section_count > 20:
        return min(base_workers + 1, 3)
    else:
        return base_workers
```

## Questions for Consideration

1. Should we prioritize depth over breadth in analysis?
2. What's the acceptable trade-off between quality and speed?
3. Should we implement user-configurable analysis parameters?
4. Do we need section-specific word limits or quality targets?
5. Should we add industry-specific analysis templates?
