## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

This analysis provides an overview of Fu Yu Corporation Limited's consolidated financial performance for FY2024 and 2H2024, focusing on the continuing manufacturing segment following the strategic discontinuation of its supply chain management services.

### Financial Summary

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") has undergone a significant strategic transformation, focusing on its core manufacturing business and discontinuing its supply chain management services segment in the last quarter of FY2024. This re-segmentation impacts comparative financial analysis. The most recent reporting period analyzed is the full financial year ended 31 December 2024 (FY2024) and the interim period of 2H2024.

### Key Recent Trends

**Revenue Growth:**
Revenue from continuing manufacturing operations grew 10.5% in FY2024, accelerating with 17.2% growth in 2H2024. This was driven by increased sales in Singapore and Malaysia, despite a decline in China. [AR p.7, p.8, p.90, FS Q424 p.4]

**Margin Evolution:**
Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for continuing operations significantly improved to 13.5% (FY2024) from 11.7% (FY2023), reflecting higher-margin projects. This trend continued in 2H2024 (13.2% vs. 11.6% in 2H2023). EBITDA margin turned strongly positive to 7.4% in FY2024 from 0.6% in FY2023. Operating Income (EBIT) also shifted to a profit. These improvements are due to higher revenue, better GPMs, and reduced selling/administrative expenses. Net loss from continuing operations narrowed sharply. [AR p.7, p.8, FS Q424 p.4]

**Cash Flow Generation:**
Operating cash flow saw a significant turnaround, shifting from a net outflow in FY2023 to a net inflow in FY2024, driven by reduced losses and better working capital management. Capex for manufacturing increased to 6.0% of revenue in FY2024 (from 3.6% in FY2023), reflecting equipment investments. [AR p.7, p.8, FS Q424 p.24]

### Performance Assessment

**Achievement vs. Guidance:**
The Chairman's message affirmed a "sharp improvement" in the core manufacturing segment in FY2024, aligning with observed margin gains and reduced net loss. Management also reported a 20% y-o-y increase in order book, signaling positive FY2025 contributions and reflecting successful strategic transformation to high-precision manufacturing, new biomedical/consumer projects, and the NPI team. [AR p.7, FS Q424 p.29, Fuyu Pres H124 p.11]

**Industry Comparison:**
While explicit industry benchmarks are absent, the Group acknowledges a 'challenging operating environment' due to geopolitical uncertainty, higher costs, and supply chain disruptions. Fu Yu positions its multi-country footprint to benefit from customers diversifying production away from China. [AR p.7, FS Q424 p.29]

**Key Drivers of Performance:**
*   **Positive Drivers:**
    *   Strategic shift to high-precision manufacturing, biomedical, and consumer segments yielding higher margins and new projects.
    *   Increased order volumes from existing customers and new wins (e.g., microfluidic chips).
    *   Significant reduction in selling and administrative expenses.
    *   Growth in Singapore and Malaysia offsetting China decline.
    *   Investment in Smart Factory and energy-efficient machinery. [AR p.7, p.8, Fuyu Pres H124 p.11, AR p.38]
*   **Challenges/Risks:**
    *   Slower economic recovery in China leading to declining, loss-making operations.
    *   Cessation of the supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) incurred S$3.3M goodwill impairment and S$2.7M net loss, further complicated by an ongoing investigation. [AR p.7, p.8, FS Q424 p.26]

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**Two Key Achievements:**
1.  **Manufacturing Turnaround:** Continuing manufacturing operations achieved a significant FY2024 turnaround: revenue grew 10.5%; EBITDA soared over 14-fold (7.4% margin from 0.6%). Net loss sharply narrowed from S$7.6M to S$1.2M. This was driven by higher-margin biomedical/consumer projects and strategic transformation. [AR p.7]
2.  **Positive Operating Cash Flow:** The Group reversed its operating cash flow from a S$(4.5)M outflow in FY2023 to a S$3.6M inflow in FY2024, demonstrating improved working capital management and financial stability. [AR p.7]

**Two Key Challenges:**
1.  **China Market Weakness:** China operations saw an 11.8% revenue decline in FY2024 and remained loss-making (LBT S$4.3M) due to 'slower business activities amid a slower-than-expected recovery.' This segment remains a drag. [AR p.8]
2.  **FYSCS Investigation & Uncertainty:** FYSCS discontinuation incurred S$3.3M goodwill impairment and S$2.7M net loss. A critical ongoing investigation (post-internal audit revealing 'significant weaknesses' and 'irregular' claims) led to a *qualified audit opinion* due to an inability to determine potential financial impact, signaling severe governance issues. [AR p.7, p.61, p.104, FS Q424 p.26]

**Two Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
1.  **FYSCS Discontinuation Rationale:** Management initially cited 'inability to identify a suitable candidate.' However, disclosures indicate this followed an internal audit uncovering 'significant weaknesses' and an investigation into alleged 'unverifiable arrangements' and 'irregular' claims. The *qualified opinion* further underscores systemic governance failures, suggesting the stated reason was a symptom, not the root cause. [FS Q44 p.26; AR p.7, p.61, p.104, Note 32]
2.  **Optimism vs. Unresolved Risks:** Management projects optimism for FY2025 (20% order book increase). While manufacturing improves, this outlook downplays significant, unresolved financial/reputational risks from the FYSCS investigation and *qualified opinion*. The potential fallout is not explicitly factored into the FY2025 optimism. [FS Q424 p.29; AR p.104]
