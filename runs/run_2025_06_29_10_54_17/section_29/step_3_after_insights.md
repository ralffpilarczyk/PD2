This analysis provides a buyside due diligence assessment of Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance, focusing on critical issues and challenging management's narrative.

## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operational narrative for the last 24 months is critically overshadowed by the **cessation of its supply chain management services segment amidst an ongoing investigation**. While the company cites "reallocation of resources," the circumstances suggest a forced rather than purely strategic divestment, introducing a significant and immediate due diligence priority regarding potential liabilities and reputational damage. Despite this critical caveat, the manufacturing segment exhibits a positive trajectory, driven by robust revenue growth, expanding gross profit margins, and a reduction in environmental intensity, indicative of strategic pivots towards high-precision manufacturing and efficiency investments (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.30).

### Top 3 Most Important Operating Metrics:

For Buyside Due Diligence, the most impactful operating metrics are **Manufacturing Revenue Growth**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **GHG Emissions Intensity**. While the latter has growing ESG importance and quantifiable cost/revenue implications, its economic materiality, compared to direct manufacturing efficiency metrics (e.g., Capacity Utilization, Inventory Turnover), for which data remains unavailable, requires rigorous quantification. The absence of such core manufacturing metrics is a key information gap for assessing overall asset efficiency and working capital management.

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue Growth

**Definition and Relevance:** Sales increase from core manufacturing operations, reflecting market demand, sales effectiveness, and market share (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). While indicating underlying volumes and/or pricing, a disaggregation is not provided.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                | Period    | Value (S$ Million) | Growth (%)       | Source                                       |
|:----------------------|:----------|:-------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Manufacturing Revenue | FY2023    | 103.9              | N/A              | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4         |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H1 2023   | 52.6               | N/A              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)*            |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H2 2023   | 51.3               | N/A              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                          |
| Manufacturing Revenue | FY2024    | 114.9              | 10.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4         |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H1 2024   | 54.8               | 4.06% (YoY H1)   | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)*            |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H2 2024   | 60.1               | 17.18% (YoY H2)  | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                          |

**Benchmarking:** No direct industry benchmarks provided, making assessment of the 10.5% FY2024 growth challenging despite a "challenging operating environment" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 8).

**Analysis of Drivers & Scrutiny:** Growth was attributed to "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). The NPI team and advanced tooling were credited. However, the lack of disaggregation between volume and pricing changes obscures the true nature of growth and its sustainability. The 11.8% decline in China operations (offset by strong Singapore/Malaysia growth) is concerning; management states "slower-than-expected recovery," but independent verification is needed on whether this reflects customer losses, pricing pressure, or strategic reprioritization (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31).

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** Management points to a "20% YoY increase in FY2024 order book" and "sticky" high-precision projects (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). However, the *firmness* of this order book and its historical *conversion rate* to revenue are critical for validation. Geographical flexibility is a strength amidst geopolitical shifts (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:** The S$11.0 million manufacturing revenue growth in FY2024 significantly drove the Group's overall S$0.9 million revenue increase, offsetting a S$10.0 million decline from the discontinued supply chain segment. This growth was instrumental in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million (FY2023) to S$1.2 million (FY2024) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7).

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  **Order Book Validation:** What is the specific breakdown of the 20% YoY order book increase by customer (new vs. existing) and product segment, its binding nature, and the anticipated revenue conversion rate for FY2025/2026? What is the *historical* conversion rate?
2.  **China Operations:** Beyond general economic recovery, what specific factors (e.g., customer churn, competitive pricing, strategic re-prioritization) drove the 11.8% China decline? What concrete plans (customer retention, new market entry) are in place to mitigate future risk and establish a recovery timeline?
3.  **Pricing vs. Volume:** Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing revenue growth attributable to unit volume increases versus average selling price changes?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Definition and Relevance:** Gross profit from the manufacturing segment as a percentage of its revenue, reflecting pricing power, cost control, and core production profitability (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7).

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                     | Period  | Value   | Change (ppt) | Source                |
|:---------------------------|:--------|:--------|:-------------|:----------------------|
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | FY2023  | S$12.1M | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM          | FY2023  | 11.7%   | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | H1 2023 | S$5.1M  | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13   |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H1 2023 | 9.7%    | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | H2 2023 | S$7.0M  | N/A          | (Calculated)**        |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H2 2023 | 13.6%   | N/A          | (Calculated)**        |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | FY2024  | S$15.5M | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM          | FY2024  | 13.5%   | +1.8 ppt     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | H1 2024 | S$7.0M  | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13   |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H1 2024 | 12.8%   | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | H2 2024 | S$8.5M  | N/A          | (Calculated)**        |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H2 2024 | 14.1%   | N/A          | (Calculated)**        |

**Benchmarking:** No direct GPM benchmarks provided. The 1.8 ppt improvement (FY2023 to FY2024) is positive, aligning with the "strategic shift towards higher-margin product categories" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Analysis of Drivers & Scrutiny:** The GPM improvement is attributed to "high-precision manufacturing" and "higher-margin product categories" enabled by the NPI team (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). However, the *specific cost structures* and *market defensibility* that define these "higher-margin" products are unclear. The consistent lower GPM in H1 compared to H2 across both years suggests potential seasonality (e.g., product mix, inventory revaluations, fixed cost absorption) that requires investigation for consistent profitability assessment. Proactive strategies for managing raw material costs and labor productivity beyond product mix are not detailed.

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** Sustained GPM improvement hinges on continued success in securing high-precision projects and moving "up the value chain" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6), supported by Smart Factory capabilities.

**Quantification of Financial Impact:** The 1.8 percentage point GPM increase resulted in an S$3.4 million rise in manufacturing gross profit (S$15.5M in FY2024 vs. S$12.1M in FY2023). This was a key factor in narrowing the Group's net loss from continuing operations.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  **Margin Drivers Detail:** Can management provide a segment-level gross profit margin breakdown by key product categories (e.g., medical devices, consumer products) and clarify *what specific factors* (e.g., specialized inputs, lower competition) make these categories "higher-margin"?
2.  **Cost Management Strategies:** What specific strategies are in place for managing raw material costs (e.g., hedging, supplier diversification) and labor productivity (e.g., automation, training) to sustain GPM as volumes increase?
3.  **Seasonal/Fluctuation Analysis:** What drives the consistent H1/H2 GPM variation, and how does management plan to mitigate this volatility or leverage it?

### 3. GHG Emissions Intensity (Manufacturing Segment)

**Definition and Relevance:** Total GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2, tCO2e) per S$ million of manufacturing revenue (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40). Indicates environmental efficiency, compliance risk, and potential for energy cost savings, brand reputation benefits, and "green" financing access.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                        | Period | Value (tCO2e/S$ mil revenue) | Reduction (%)   | Source          |
|:------------------------------|:-------|:-----------------------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| GHG Emissions Intensity       | FY2023 | 214.4                        | N/A             | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| GHG Emissions Intensity       | FY2024 | 191.9                        | 10.5% (YoY)     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| Total Electricity Consumption | FY2023 | 116,481.6 GJ                 | N/A             | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |
| Total Electricity Consumption | FY2024 | 113,623.0 GJ                 | 2.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |

**Benchmarking:** No specific industry benchmark provided. The 10.5% YoY reduction significantly exceeds the short-term target of 3.0% (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.41).

**Analysis of Drivers & Scrutiny:** Reduction stems from energy efficiency (new machines, LED lighting, 2.5% decrease in purchased electricity) and renewable energy adoption (solar panel installation in Singapore, 4,001.8 GJ generated on-site in FY2024). Operational optimization also contributed (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 38). While positive for ESG, the *economic materiality* of these improvements on the P&L needs to be clearly quantified relative to other operational levers, especially given the capital expenditure involved.

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** This trend is sustainable given ongoing strategic investments and explicit targets to "explore and implement cleaner energy solutions" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.17).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:** The 2.5% reduction in purchased electricity (2,858.6 GJ saved) contributes directly to energy cost savings, estimated to be approximately S$143,000 (assuming S$0.18/kWh based on regional industrial rates). Furthermore, the generation of 4,001.8 GJ of solar energy reduces reliance on grid power. The sale of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for 3,996.0 GJ in FY2024 offers a direct *revenue opportunity*, potentially generating an estimated S$36,000 (assuming S$9/REC for Singapore market). Indirectly, these practices may improve access to green financing and investor confidence (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.37). While beneficial, the *overall financial impact* on the P&L is less significant than core revenue and GPM drivers for a manufacturing firm.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  **Energy Cost Savings & Unit Costs:** Provide a detailed breakdown of actual and projected energy cost savings (in S$ terms) for FY2024/FY2025 by region, quantifying their impact on the overall cost per unit of production.
2.  **Capex & ROI for Decarbonization:** What is the detailed roadmap and capital expenditure plan to achieve the 30% Scope 2 emissions reduction target by FY2030, including specific technology upgrades, estimated costs, and anticipated financial returns (ROI) on these investments, especially against other potential capital deployments?
3.  **Green Financing Impact:** Has the reduced GHG intensity directly led to lower cost of capital or specific green financing opportunities, and how is this quantified?
