ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
- **Prioritize Value-Driven Insights:** Focus on generating insights that directly link operational activities to quantifiable business outcomes (e.g., cost savings, efficiency gains, risk reduction) and identify key levers for improvement.
- **Employ Diagnostic and Prescriptive Approaches:** Move beyond descriptive data presentation by applying root cause analysis to understand *why* issues occur and developing actionable recommendations for *what* to do about them.
- **Map Process Dependencies:** Systematically identify and analyze the relationships between inputs, process steps, resources, and outputs to reveal critical dependencies and leverage points for optimizing efficiency and performance.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
- **Conduct Comprehensive Scoping Upfront:** Before detailed analysis, perform a thorough scoping exercise to identify all relevant data sources, key stakeholders, and potential upstream/downstream process impacts to prevent significant gaps in completeness.
- **Proactively Seek Root Causes and Quantify Impact:** Avoid merely describing symptoms by incorporating root cause analysis and quantifying the operational and financial impact of identified issues from the outset, transforming observations into actionable insights.
- **Define Problem and Hypotheses Early:** Begin the analysis with a clear problem statement and develop testable hypotheses to guide data collection and analysis, ensuring a focused and insight-driven approach rather than purely exploratory data presentation.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
- **Utilize Visual Process Mapping:** For operational sections, employ process mapping tools (e.g., flowcharts, value stream maps) to visually represent current state operations, pinpointing specific bottlenecks, redundancies, and points of friction or waste.
- **Ensure Actionable Recommendations with Implementation Pathways:** Every identified operational issue must be accompanied by concrete, actionable recommendations, ideally with consideration for proposed implementation steps, resource requirements, and change management implications.
- **Focus on Quantifiable Root Cause Depth:** Prioritize analytical depth that not only identifies operational inefficiencies but also uncovers their root causes and quantifies their impact (e.g., time, cost, quality, resource utilization) to provide compelling justification for proposed changes.
