## SECTION 4: Key Suppliers Analysis

Maxis Berhad's supplier relationships are crucial for its operations as a leading integrated telecommunications provider. Its supply chain covers network infrastructure, maintenance, content delivery, and corporate support. Maxis emphasizes managing supply chain risks and fostering ethical, sustainable supplier relationships.

### a. List of Largest Suppliers and Supplier Concentration

A critical analytical gap remains as specific non-related major suppliers—such as key network equipment vendors (e.g., Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia)—are not individually named with transaction values. This omission prevents a full assessment of critical dependencies, technological lock-in risks, and exposure to geopolitical factors impacting core infrastructure.

**Key Procurement Overview (RM million)**

| Category                         | 2024 Value | Percentage of Total Procurement (RM7.1bn) | Key Insight                                                                     |
| :------------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Total Related Party Procurement  | 179        | 2.52%                                     | Minor portion of overall procurement, despite disclosure.                       |
| Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB)    | 80         | 1.13%                                     | Significant new related party, reflecting 5G rollout.                           |
| Local Suppliers (of RM7.1bn)     | 6,100      | 86%                                       | Strong reliance on local sourcing, enhancing resilience.                        |
| Foreign Suppliers (of RM7.1bn)   | 1,000      | 14%                                       | Vulnerability to international logistics, trade policies, and currency.         |

Related-party transactions (RM179 million in 2024) constitute a mere 2.52% of Maxis's total RM7.1 billion supplier allocation. This contradicts any assertion of related parties being significant, suggesting primary concentration risk lies with undisclosed non-related parties. Maxis's 86% reliance on local sourcing (RM6.1 billion) enhances resilience and reduces foreign exchange exposure. However, the 14% foreign component (RM1.0 billion) implies vulnerability to international logistics, trade policies, and currency fluctuations, particularly for critical imported network equipment.

### b. Supplier Risk Management and Performance

Maxis's supply chain operates under a structured Procurement Policy, covering supplier onboarding, sourcing, selection, and evaluation. Risk mitigation involves periodic procurement risk assessments. Ethical conduct is enforced via mandatory adherence to the Maxis Code of Business Practice (MCOBP) and Integrity Pledge Statements. Employees also receive annual training on the Code of Conduct.

Maxis's Vendor Performance Evaluation (VPE), introduced in January 2024, assessed 362 contracts from 252 vendors, reporting 89% met or exceeded a baseline score of 80%. While suggesting high satisfaction, identified improvement areas like project management efficiency, timely documentation, and proactive communication indicate persistent operational challenges. Strategies include constant dialogue with critical suppliers, exploring alternative sourcing, and inserting risk/indemnity clauses.

Despite these efforts, analysis is limited by the absence of specific, measurable KPIs for critical non-related suppliers. While the VPE provides an aggregate score, a deeper understanding of Maxis's ability to control costs, ensure long-term supply chain resilience, and drive innovation remains constrained by this lack of granular data and specific commercial terms. This transparency gap regarding major non-related suppliers remains a significant analytical challenge for assessing Maxis's true supply chain resilience and strategic dependencies.
