*   **China:** Three manufacturing facilities: Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Dongguan) Co., Ltd, Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, and Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd. While historically a large contributor, the Group is observing a shift, with China operations increasingly focused on "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" strategies due to geopolitical uncertainty.

**b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance and Their Ownership**
The Group's primary operating assets are its manufacturing facilities and the machinery within them.
*   **Production Floor Capacity:** The Group boasts over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity across its 6 manufacturing sites. This scale allows for high-volume production and caters to a diverse customer base. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, "Company Profile"]
*   **Flagship Smart Factory (Singapore):** This is a critical strategic asset, emphasizing high-end precision manufacturing, advanced tooling, 3D metal printing, and cleanroom capabilities for the life sciences and medical sectors. Its advanced features enhance the Group's value proposition for complex and high-margin products. The usable space is 9,348 sqm. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"]
*   **Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):** These form the backbone of the manufacturing operations, representing the physical infrastructure and machinery.
*   **Investment Property (Malaysia):** A leasehold property in Johor, Malaysia, held to earn rental income, partially offsetting operational costs. The land area is 34,000 sqm with a build-up area of 15,589 sqm. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 114, "Investment property"]
*   **Ownership:** The Group primarily owns its manufacturing facilities (PPE, including leasehold properties), with some assets potentially under finance leases (right-of-use assets). The investment property is also leasehold.

**c. Operating Certifications:**
All 6 manufacturing sites hold ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management), ISO 13485:2016 (Medical Devices Quality Management), and ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management) certifications. Singapore and Dongguan facilities also hold IATF 16949:2016, which is critical for automotive sector clients. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 16, "Awards and Certifications"]

### 3. Human Resources Distribution

**a. Employee Headcount & Distribution**
The Group's workforce consists primarily of permanent, full-time employees, supplemented by temporary staff.
*   **Total Employees:** 1,372 (as of 31 Dec 2024), comprising 1,241 permanent and 131 temporary staff. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 48, "Employment"]
*   **Employee Distribution by Region (as of 31 Dec 2024):**
    *   Singapore: 484 employees (203 Male, 281 Female)
    *   Malaysia: 358 employees (204 Male, 154 Female)
    *   China: 530 employees (279 Male, 251 Female)
    *   Total: 1,372 employees (686 Male, 686 Female) [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"]
*   **Note on Functional Distribution:** The provided annual report does not detail employee distribution by specific functions (e.g., manufacturing, R&D, sales, administration).

**b. Employee Diversity**
The Group reports a near 1:1 male to female employee ratio (50% male, 50% female) as of FY2024. The majority of the workforce (61.4%) is aged between 30 to 50 years. However, the Board of Directors remains 100% male, indicating a lack of gender diversity at the highest leadership level. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 54, "Diversity and Equal Opportunity"]

**c. Training & Development**
The average training hours per employee decreased to 13.2 hours in FY2024, down from 16.0 hours in FY2023 and 17.0 hours in FY2022. This reduction is attributed to "training budget control and shift in company priorities," with more impact on on-the-job training. The Group targets 15 hours per employee for FY2025. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 56, "Training and Education"]

**d. Occupational Health & Safety**
The recordable work-related injuries rate increased to 4.6 in FY2024 from 3.5 in FY2023, though it remains lower than 6.1 in FY2022. No workplace fatalities were reported. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 59, "Occupational Health and Safety"]

### 4. Key Changes and Trends in Operating Footprint

**a. Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):**
A significant change is the Group's decision to cease all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) in the last quarter of FY2024. This was due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" and to "reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business." This segment contributed S$76.4 million to revenue in FY2024 (39.9% of total Group revenue). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"; Page 8, "Business Segment Review"; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 11, "Corporate Information", Page 15, "Discontinued Operations"]
*   **Implication:** While ceasing FYSCS simplifies the business and re-focuses on manufacturing, the reason cited ("inability to identify a suitable candidate") raises questions about internal talent management or attractiveness of the role. The ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs, highlighted by the qualified audit opinion, presents significant non-financial risks (reputational damage, management distraction, potential legal liabilities) that could impact long-term viability and investor confidence, despite management's claim of isolation to FYSCS. This is a critical disconnect between the stated "reallocation of resources" and the underlying "significant weaknesses" and "unverifiable arrangements" identified by auditors.

**b. Investment in Smart Factory & Automation:**
The Group continues to invest in its Singapore Smart Factory, installing Industry 4.0 machinery, offering high-precision tooling, and 3D metal printing. They are increasing automation levels in toolrooms to reduce downtime by 40% and are stabilizing 5-micron precision levels, aiming for even higher precision. The Group is progressively replacing hydraulic machinery with electric alternatives for efficiency and reduced oil consumption. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"; Page 47, "Innovative Production"]

**c. Sustainability Initiatives:**
Fu Yu is actively integrating renewable energy. Solar panels were installed on Singapore facilities in FY2024, and installations in Johor and Penang facilities became operational in 4Q2024 and 2Q2025, respectively. These are expected to generate up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy. The Group also focuses on water conservation (9.1% decrease in water consumption in FY2024 vs FY2023) and waste reduction (25.7% reduction in hazardous waste in FY2024 vs FY2023). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"; Page 37, "Energy Consumption"; Page 41, "Water Consumption"; Page 44, "Waste"; Page 47, "Renewable Energy"]

**d. Geographical Revenue Mix Shift:**
There's a clear trend of declining revenue contribution from China operations, offset by growth in Singapore and Malaysia.
*   **China Contribution to Manufacturing Revenue:** 27.9% (FY2024) vs. 35.0% (FY2023) [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "Business Segment Review"]
*   **Singapore Manufacturing Revenue Growth:** +20.9% (FY2024 vs FY2023) [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "Business Segment Review"]
*   **Malaysia Manufacturing Revenue Growth:** +24.9% (FY2024 vs FY2023) [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "Business Segment Review"]
*   **Insight:** This shift aligns with external market trends where customers seek to diversify production away from China due to geopolitical uncertainty. Fu Yu's multi-country presence allows it to capitalize on this trend, isolating controllable factors (strategic reallocation of resources, investment in Singapore/Malaysia) from uncontrollable factors (China's economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions). The increased order book (20% YoY at end FY2024) suggests this strategic shift is gaining traction.

### 5. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

*   **Vertically-Integrated One-Stop Solution:** The Group offers comprehensive services from product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing. This end-to-end capability enhances value-add for customers and builds long-term partnerships, making it a "sticky" business. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, "Company Profile"; Page 5, "Chairman's Message"]
*   **High-Precision Manufacturing & Advanced Technology:** The focus on high-end precision plastic and metal components, particularly through the Smart Factory's capabilities (cleanroom, 3D printing, complex tooling), positions Fu Yu for higher-margin projects in sectors like medical devices, life sciences, and advanced consumer products. This technological edge supports its reputation as a "trusted manufacturing partner for innovative, high-performance products." [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"]
*   **Geographical Flexibility:** With manufacturing sites in three countries, Fu Yu can offer customers "geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty." This is a key competitive advantage for customers looking to de-risk their supply chains away from a single region. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"]
*   **Sustainability as a Differentiator:** The Group's commitment to sustainable practices, including renewable energy integration, eco-friendly materials, and waste reduction, not only aligns with global trends but also enhances its reputation and appeals to environmentally conscious customers and investors. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, "Company Profile"; Page 32, "Shift in customer preferences towards eco-friendly products"]

### 7. Insights & Implications

The analysis of Fu Yu's operating footprint reveals a strategic pivot and ongoing efforts to enhance its competitive position, albeit with some areas requiring closer scrutiny and highlighting data limitations.

**Strategic Re-orientation and Market Adaptation:** The decision to cease FYSCS operations and reallocate resources to core manufacturing is a bold move. Management attributes this to an "inability to identify a suitable candidate" and a desire to "emphasize its key manufacturing capabilities" [Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 15]. However, the accompanying qualified audit opinion and ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 104, "Independent Auditor's Report"; Page 138, "Ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd."] present a significant non-financial risk. This disconnect between management's positive framing and the auditor's red flag suggests that the cessation might be more reactive to underlying issues than a purely proactive strategic choice. The potential for reputational damage, legal costs, and management distraction from the core business cannot be understated, even if the financial impact is currently isolated. This challenges the optimistic claims and highlights what might not be fully disclosed regarding the depth of FYSCS's problems.

**Geographic Shift as a Competitive Advantage:** The declining revenue contribution from China (27.9% in FY2024, down from 35.0% in FY2023) coupled with robust growth in Singapore (+20.9%) and Malaysia (+24.9%) manufacturing revenue is a critical trend. This aligns perfectly with the external market trend of "more customers seek to source production away from China" due to geopolitical uncertainty [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"]. Fu Yu's established presence in three countries allows it to capitalize on this supply chain diversification trend, turning an uncontrollable external factor (geopolitical tensions) into a controllable strategic advantage (offering geographical flexibility). The 20% year-on-year increase in the order book at the end of FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"] strongly indicates the success of this strategic alignment.

**Investment in High-Value Capabilities:** The continued investment in the Singapore Smart Factory, its 100K-class cleanroom, 3D metal printing, and pursuit of 5-micron precision levels positions Fu Yu at the high-end of precision engineering. This focus on advanced capabilities (e.g., microfluidic chips, drug delivery devices) attracts "higher-margin product categories" and "global leaders" as customers [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message"; Fuyu Pres H124, Page 11, "New Projects and Collaborations"]. This strategy supports long-term sustainable revenue by securing "sticky" projects involving high-precision tooling. The increase in capital expenditure for Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) from FY2023 to FY2024 reflects this commitment to technological advancement.

**Human Capital Management: A Potential Red Flag:** While the Group highlights its commitment to employees, the significant drop in average training hours per employee from 16.0 hours in FY2023 to 13.2 hours in FY2024, attributed to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 56, "Training and Education"], raises a concern. Compared to a general manufacturing industry benchmark of 20-40 hours per employee annually for skilled roles, Fu Yu's current training hours appear low. In a high-precision, technologically advanced industry, continuous skill development is paramount. Reduced training could lead to a long-term degradation of employee capabilities, impacting innovation, quality, and ultimately competitive positioning. The turnover rate of 24.9% in FY2024, while significantly lower than FY2023's 63.8%, is still at the higher end of typical manufacturing industry averages (often 15-25% in Southeast Asia). This high turnover, coupled with reduced training, is a non-financial risk that could undermine the effectiveness of operational cost reductions and potentially lead to customer service degradation if skilled labor is not adequately maintained. The lack of employee distribution by function also limits a deeper understanding of how human resources are allocated across critical areas like R&D, production, and quality control. Furthermore, the 100% male Board of Directors indicates a lack of diversity at the top, which can impact decision-making and broader talent attraction.

**Occupational Health & Safety Concerns:** The increase in the recordable work-related injuries rate to 4.6 in FY2024 from 3.5 in FY2023 is a worrying trend. When compared to the average Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) for the manufacturing sector in the US (e.g., OSHA's average around 3.0-3.5), Fu Yu's rate of 4.6 is notably higher, suggesting potential weaknesses in safety protocols or implementation. While no fatalities were reported, the rising injury rate indicates a need for immediate attention to ensure employee well-being and operational continuity.

**Sustainability as an Operational Imperative:** The Group's initiatives in solar energy, water conservation, and waste reduction are commendable and align with global sustainability trends. The 2.5% decrease in electricity consumption and 9.1% decrease in water consumption in FY2024, alongside significant hazardous waste reduction (25.7%), demonstrate tangible operational improvements. These efforts not only contribute to a "greener, more responsible footprint" but also mitigate transitional risks associated with rising energy prices and regulatory oversight, potentially leading to reduced operational costs in the long run. This proactive stance on environmental stewardship can also enhance brand reputation and appeal to a growing segment of environmentally conscious customers.

**Data Limitations:** It is important to note that comprehensive interim data (e.g., quarterly figures) for most operational metrics such as employee headcount, training hours, and energy consumption is not explicitly provided in the annual report or interim presentations. Additionally, the number of customers, a key operational metric, was not disclosed in the provided documents. These data gaps limit the ability to conduct more granular trend analysis and assess operational performance on a shorter-term basis.
