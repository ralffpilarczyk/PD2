### b. Corporate Strategies

Corporate strategies define how the company leverages its existing assets and capabilities to compete effectively *now*.

1.  **Strategy: Leverage Vertically-Integrated Manufacturing for "One-Stop Solution"**
    *   **Definition:** Fu Yu positions itself as a comprehensive manufacturing partner offering end-to-end services from product design to final assembly and testing, aiming to build long-term customer partnerships by providing a seamless, integrated solution [AR, p.3; SR, p.18].
    *   **Required Capabilities:**
        *   Over 45 years of operating knowledge and precision engineering expertise [AR, p.3].
        *   Existing infrastructure including 6 strategic manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, with over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity [AR, p.3].
        *   Specialized facilities like the Smart Factory in Singapore, capable of complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products [AR, p.3, p.5].
        *   Capabilities in New Product Introduction (NPI) and material selection services (e.g., eco-friendly alternatives) [SR, p.18].
        *   Expertise in various production methods including plastic injection moulding and metal injection moulding [SR, p.18].
        *   Comprehensive secondary processes and product assembly services for box-build requirements [SR, p.18].
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:**
        *   Established since 1978 and listed since 1995, indicating a long history and established market presence [AR, p.3].
        *   Historically served a diverse and loyal international customer base across life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, and industrial sectors [AR, p.3].
        *   Competition is intense ("competitive nature of the industry" [AR, p.84]), requiring a differentiated offering like a "one-stop solution" to maintain and expand market share. This is a continuation of its core business model.

2.  **Strategy: Provide Geographical Flexibility to Mitigate Geopolitical Risks**
    *   **Definition:** Offer manufacturing solutions across multiple countries (Singapore, Malaysia, China) to provide customers with supply chain resilience and options to diversify production away from single-country risks, particularly China [AR, p.5].
    *   **Required Capabilities:**
        *   Existing manufacturing footprint in Singapore, Malaysia, and China [AR, p.3, p.14].
        *   Operational experience and established local networks in each region [AR, p.3, p.14].
        *   Ability to manage cross-border logistics and coordination [AR, p.3].
        *   A Singapore-headquartered and SGX-listed status lends credibility and neutrality amidst geopolitical tensions [AR, p.5].
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:**
        *   Direct response to "geopolitical uncertainty" and customers seeking to "source production away from China" [AR, p.5].
        *   Historically, China operations contributed a significant portion of manufacturing revenue (35.0% in FY2023), which has now reduced to 27.9% in FY2024, with Singapore and Malaysia gaining share [AR, p.5, p.9]. This shows an active shift in the revenue mix, aligning with the strategy.

3.  **Strategy: Customer-Centric Engagement and Relationship Building**
    *   **Definition:** Actively engage with customers from early stages of the product lifecycle (e.g., product design, New Product Introduction - NPI) to build strong, long-term partnerships and ensure customer confidence in scaling production and maintaining quality [AR, p.3, p.5].
    *   **Required Capabilities:**
        *   Dedicated NPI team capable of adding value in early business cycles [AR, p.5].

### Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While Fu Yu presents a coherent strategic direction, several notable disconnects emerge when challenging optimistic claims and considering other available information:

1.  **FYSCS Scandal vs. Corporate Governance & Strategic Focus:**
    *   **Objective/Claim:** To uphold the "highest standards of corporate governance" [AR, p.5] and strategically reallocate resources to core manufacturing [AR, p.5; FS Q424, p.29].
    *   **Reality:** The discontinuation of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) is optimistically framed as "inability to identify a suitable candidate" [FS Q424, p.26]. However, the documents reveal an *ongoing investigation into significant weaknesses in FYSCS's risk management, fraud risks, unauthorized email usage, irregular expense claims, and potential misuse of resources* [AR, p.7, p.99, p.103; FS Q424, p.26-27]. This directly contradicts claims of high corporate governance standards.
    *   **Implication:** This major governance failure, leading to potential claims against individuals and affecting a significant portion of previous revenue (39.9% of total revenue in FY2024 [AR, p.8]), casts a shadow on the Group's internal controls and management oversight, despite management's assurances it "do[es] not impact our continuing operations" [AR, p.5]. The auditor's *qualified opinion* based on this ongoing investigation [AR, p.104] is a critical red flag.
    *   **Further Disconnect:** The Notice of Annual General Meeting reveals a substantial shareholder's (Lim Wei De Victor, 29.45% stake) requisition to *remove two incumbent independent directors and appoint four new ones* [AR, p.183-184]. This suggests deep internal dissatisfaction with the current board's oversight and potentially its strategic direction, contrasting with the Board's self-assessment of "appropriate balance of skills and experience" [AR, p.78].

2.  **"Growth Trajectory" vs. Financial Performance & Market Challenges:**
    *   **Objective/Claim:** The Chairman asserts Fu Yu is "clearly on a growth trajectory" and new projects "will translate into long-term sustainable revenue" [AR, p.5]. The outlook for FY2025 is "optimistic" for improvement [FS Q424, p.30].
    *   **Reality:** Despite improvements, the Group is *still in a net loss position* for FY2024 (S$3.9 million total net loss) [AR, p.8; FS Q424, p.4]. The 2H2024 revenue for the Group significantly *decreased* by 45.8% compared to 2H2023, largely due to the FYSCS discontinuation [FS Q424, p.29]. This indicates that while manufacturing performance improved, the overall top-line is impacted by the strategic exit. The "growth trajectory" seems more aspirational than definitively established, especially given the "challenging operating environment," "longer shipping lead times," "higher costs of raw materials," and "geopolitical tensions" [FS Q424, p.30].

3.  **Talent Development & Retention vs. Practice:**
    *   **Objective/Claim:** "Strategic recruitment, retention, and development of human capital is of utmost importance" [SR, p.57].
    *   **Reality:** The FY2024 employee turnover rate was 24.9% [SR, p.51]. Furthermore, average training hours per employee *decreased* from 16 hours (FY2023) to 13.2 hours (FY2024) due to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" [SR, p.57].
    *   **Implication:** This suggests a disconnect where stated importance of human capital development does not fully align with actual resource allocation or outcomes (decreased training, high turnover), potentially impacting long-term capability development.

### Conclusion

Fu Yu's strategic objectives for the foreseeable future are clearly centered on strengthening its high-precision manufacturing core, achieving financial turnaround, and deepening its commitment to sustainability. Its corporate strategies, particularly leveraging its vertically-integrated model and geographical flexibility, appear well-aligned with these objectives, especially in the context of global supply chain shifts.

However, the analysis reveals significant disconnects. The severity of the FYSCS investigation, coupled with the attempt to remove existing board members, points to internal governance issues that are being downplayed in official narratives. This profoundly impacts confidence in management's ability to execute its "growth trajectory" and uphold "highest standards of corporate governance." While financial performance from continuing operations shows positive signs of recovery, the overall loss-making position and the immediate impact of the FYSCS exit on top-line revenue indicate that the "growth trajectory" is more a future aspiration than a current reality. Furthermore, a decline in employee training hours and high turnover raise questions about the practical implementation of human capital development strategies. Investors should closely monitor the outcome of the FYSCS investigation and the ongoing board dynamics as these will be critical determinants of the Group's future strategic execution and financial health.
