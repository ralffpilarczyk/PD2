ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
-   **Prioritize cross-functional synthesis to reveal systemic issues:** Actively connect observations across financial, operational, legal, and market sections to uncover interdependent risks or hidden value drivers that single-threaded analysis would miss.
-   **Quantify qualitative findings to demonstrate tangible impact:** Translate non-financial observations (e.g., operational bottlenecks, regulatory risks, IP weaknesses) into potential financial implications (e.g., revenue loss, cost increases, valuation adjustments) to make insights actionable.
-   **Focus on forward-looking implications and 'so what':** Move beyond historical description to project the future impact of current findings, including potential opportunities, threats, and required actions.
-   **Apply multi-level root cause analysis:** For every significant observation or finding, drill down to identify the underlying causes, asking "why" multiple times to reach the fundamental drivers or issues.
-   **Leverage comparative analysis against benchmarks:** Systematically compare the target's performance, practices, and market position against industry standards, best practices, and competitors to identify strengths, weaknesses, and outliers.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
-   **Avoid merely descriptive aggregation; frame initial drafts around key hypotheses:** Do not just compile data. From the outset, approach the analysis with preliminary hypotheses about potential risks, opportunities, or value drivers to guide data collection and initial structuring.
-   **Proactively identify and quantify the 'so what' of each observation:** Integrate the impact assessment (financial, operational, strategic) from the very beginning of analysis, rather than deferring it to later stages of completeness or insight generation.
-   **Ensure comprehensive coverage with a pre-defined due diligence checklist:** Use a structured framework or checklist that explicitly includes all critical areas (e.g., commercial, operational, legal, HR, IP, technology, regulatory) to prevent gaps in the initial draft.
-   **Challenge assumptions and cross-validate data from multiple sources early:** Do not accept data at face value. Actively seek to corroborate information through alternative sources, interviews, or logical consistency checks to avoid building conclusions on faulty premises.
-   **Do not defer detailed risk assessment and mitigation analysis:** Integrate the identification, assessment, and preliminary mitigation strategies for risks as they emerge, rather than treating it as a separate, later phase.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
-   **Structure due diligence sections around investment risks, opportunities, and value drivers:** Organize findings not just by functional area (e.g., financials, legal) but primarily by their direct relevance to the investment thesis, deal terms, or potential acquisition value.
-   **Always quantify the potential financial impact of qualitative findings:** For due diligence, explicitly model or estimate the monetary consequences of non-financial findings (e.g., legal liabilities, environmental remediation costs, operational inefficiencies) to inform decision-makers.
-   **Prioritize the assessment of key contracts, intellectual property, and regulatory compliance:** These areas frequently harbor deal-breaker risks or significant contingent liabilities that warrant deep, early scrutiny in any due diligence process.
-   **Develop a clear executive summary that distills critical actionables upfront:** The initial section must concisely present the most significant red flags, green flags, and actionable recommendations, enabling quick comprehension for busy decision-makers.
-   **Beyond historical performance, deeply analyze scalability, sustainability, and unit economics:** For due diligence, focus analytical depth on whether current success is sustainable, how operations can scale, and the underlying profitability drivers (e.g., customer acquisition cost, lifetime value) to project future viability.
