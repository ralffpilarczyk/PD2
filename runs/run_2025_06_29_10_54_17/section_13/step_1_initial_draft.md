## SECTION 13: Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies Analysis

This section analyzes Fu Yu Corporation Limited's strategic goals and current corporate strategies, drawing a clear distinction between the two. The analysis also identifies key disconnects and leverages a critical stance on management's reporting.

### A. Strategic Objectives

Strategic objectives are the forward-looking goals the company aims to achieve, often over defined timeframes, with specific metrics and resource considerations.

**Top 3 Strategic Objectives:**

1.  **Elevate Precision Manufacturing & Value Chain Focus**
    *   **Objective:** To stabilize high-precision products at the 5-micron level and advance further up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision products (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). This is explicitly linked to securing projects in higher-margin product categories such as medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5).
    *   **Timeframe and Horizons:** This is an ongoing, medium-to-long-term objective, evidenced by the continuous pursuit of "even higher levels of precision" and the "long-term sustainable revenue" expected from high-precision projects (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Success Metrics and KPIs:** Success is implicitly measured by securing new projects in target industries (medical devices, drone technology, smart appliances) and translating gestating high-precision projects into mass production (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). Revenue growth from these high-margin segments will be a key indicator.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Significant investment in the Singapore Smart Factory, equipped with Industry 4.0 machinery, advanced tooling capabilities (complex mould inserts, 3D metal printing), and a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3; Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5). Capital expenditure (CAPEX) in FY2024 totaled S\$6.9 million, primarily for the "purchase of factory equipment, plant and machineries" (Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8; Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 10). The establishment of a New Product Introduction ("NPI") team is a key human capital investment supporting this objective (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4).

2.  **Increase Operational Automation & Efficiency**
    *   **Objective:** To increase automation levels within the toolroom to enable continuous production, including overnight and weekend operations, aiming for a 40% reduction in downtime compared to a typical facility (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). This is supported by the completion of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform testing (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Timeframe and Horizons:** This initiative is set to increase "from this year" (FY2025 onwards), indicating a short-to-medium-term focus on operational improvement (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Success Metrics and KPIs:** The primary metric is a "40% reduction in downtime" in the toolroom (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). Other implicit KPIs include improved production efficiency and cost savings from reduced human intervention and optimized workflows.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Investment in Industry 4.0 machinery and an ERP integrated cloud-based IT platform (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5, 6). This aligns with the CAPEX of S$6.9 million in FY2024 (Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8).

3.  **Enhance Environmental Sustainability (Carbon Reduction)**
    *   **Objective:** To reduce overall Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by FY2030, using FY2023 as the baseline (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41).
    *   **Timeframe and Horizons:** This is a defined medium-term target (by FY2030) (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41).
    *   **Success Metrics and KPIs:** The direct KPI is a "30% reduction in Scope 2 overall emissions" from the FY2023 baseline (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41). A short-term target was also set to reduce Scope 2 carbon emissions by 3.0% in FY2024 (actual achievement was 1.4%) (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41).
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Installation of solar panels on facilities in Singapore (completed FY2024), Johor (operational Q4 FY2024), and Penang (expected operational Q2 FY2025), aiming to generate up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5; Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 47). Progressive replacement of older hydraulic machinery with energy-efficient electric alternatives (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 32, 47). Exploration of green financing options (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 35).

### B. Corporate Strategies

Corporate strategies describe how the company is currently leveraging its existing assets and capabilities to compete in the market. A strategy must be feasible by definition, focusing on present actions rather than future aspirations or plans.

**Top 3 Corporate Strategies:**

1.  **Divest Non-Core Supply Chain Business to Re-focus on Core High-Precision Manufacturing**
    *   **Strategy:** Fu Yu has taken concrete action by ceasing all business activities in its supply chain management arm, Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS), in the last quarter of FY2024. This was explicitly done to "reallocate resources to our core manufacturing business" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5). This strategy emphasizes doing "what we do best â€“ high-precision manufacturing" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Leverage existing vertically-integrated manufacturing services, deep operating knowledge spanning over 45 years in high-end precision plastic and metal components, and products (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3). Key assets include the Singapore Smart Factory (Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facility), capable of complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, and 3D metal printing, alongside a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3).
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:** The manufacturing segment showed a "sharp improvement" in FY2024, the first in over a decade, attributed to this focus (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4). Conversely, the FYSCS segment's revenue declined in FY2024, and it faced "significant weaknesses" in its risk management processes, leading to an ongoing internal investigation (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5; Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 15, Note 32). This strategic move addresses underperforming non-core assets and inherent operational risks.

2.  **Leverage Geographically Diversified Manufacturing Footprint to Mitigate Geopolitical Risk**
    *   **Strategy:** Fu Yu is actively utilizing its manufacturing presence in Singapore, Malaysia, and China to offer "geographical flexibility" to customers, responding to the trend of companies seeking to diversify production away from China amid geopolitical uncertainties (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Operational manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China with over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3). Established supply chain resilience across these regions (Risk Management Report, FY2024, p. 100).
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:** Geopolitical tensions are explicitly noted as a driver for customers to "source production away from China" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). The revenue contribution from Singapore and Malaysia operations significantly increased (gained 20.9 ppt and 24.9 ppt respectively) in FY2024, while China's contribution decreased by 7.1 ppt, validating the effectiveness of this geographic diversification strategy (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4; Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8).

3.  **Deepen Customer Relationships through Enhanced Value-Added Services**
    *   **Strategy:** Fu Yu offers a "one-stop solution" for customers' manufacturing needs, encompassing product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3). A key component of this is the New Product Introduction ("NPI") team, which provides value in the early stages of the business cycle, giving customers confidence in scalability and quality (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Expertise in product design, innovative tooling design and fabrication (including access to customised moulds), plastic and metal injection moulding capabilities, and comprehensive secondary processes for "box build assembly" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 18). A skilled engineering workforce is fundamental (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 18).
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:** This strategy has already resulted in securing "new projects across a broad spectrum of industries" and refreshing the customer base to include "global leaders" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5). This demonstrates tangible success in deepening partnerships and expanding market reach by offering comprehensive solutions rather than just manufacturing components.

### C. Disconnects Between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While Fu Yu's objectives and strategies show alignment, certain areas present potential disconnects that warrant attention:

1.  **Human Capital Development for High-Precision Focus (Strategic Shift Verification):**
    *   **Disconnect:** A stated strategic objective is to move towards "even higher levels of precision" which inherently demands advanced skills and continuous learning (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). However, the Group's average training hours *decreased* from 16 hours per employee in FY2023 to 13.2 hours in FY2024, attributed to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 56). This reduction in human capital investment directly contradicts the stated need for enhanced capabilities required for higher precision and value-added services.
    *   **Implication:** This underinvestment in training, despite the increased CAPEX on machinery, suggests a potential misalignment in resource allocation that could hinder the long-term achievement of the high-precision objective, as advanced machinery still requires highly skilled operators and technical staff.

2.  **Achieving Zero Workplace Incidents (Challenging Optimistic Claims):**
    *   **Disconnect:** The Group is "committed to achieving a zero-workplace incident rate" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 60). However, the "Recordable work-related injuries rate saw an increase from 3.5 in FY2023 to 4.6 in FY2024" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 60).
    *   **Implication:** While the overall trend for lost days might be managed, an increasing incident *rate* suggests that current safety practices are not yet effectively mitigating all risks, creating a gap between the ambitious "zero-incident" objective and the actual operational outcomes. This is a critical area for operational focus and re-evaluation of safety protocols.

3.  **Profitability and Strategic Refocus (Critical Stance):**
    *   **Disconnect:** The strategic shift to core manufacturing and divestment of the problematic supply chain segment is highlighted as a success, leading to a "sharp improvement" in the core segment (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4). However, the Group still recorded a net loss of S\$3.9 million in FY2024 (narrowed from S\$10.1 million in FY2023) (Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8).
    *   **Implication:** While the trajectory is positive, management's optimistic claims of "early successes" and "growth trajectory" need to be viewed critically against the continued overall loss. The stated confidence in "long-term sustainable revenue" from high-precision projects is an aspiration that is yet to fully materialize into overall group profitability, indicating that the strategic execution, while improving, has not yet achieved the ultimate financial goal of sustained positive net income for the entire group.
