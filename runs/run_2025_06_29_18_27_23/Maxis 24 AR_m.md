#### **STRENGTHENING OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY**

**2025 marks a significant milestone for Maxis as we celebrate 30 years of excellence as a homegrown brand. Over these three decades, we have transformed how Malaysians connect and communicate, playing a vital role in advancing digital inclusion and innovation across the nation.**

**As the newly appointed Chairman, I am honoured to lead Maxis at a time when we stand firmly as Malaysia's leading integrated telco. We are committed to delivering exceptional services and solutions that empower individuals, businesses and communities. In doing so, we will keep the Maxis name synonymous with quality, reliability and progress.** 

#### **EMPOWERING CONNECTIONS, DRIVING PROGRESS**

In 2024, Malaysia experienced encouraging growth, with GDP rising by 5.1%1 , driven by robust domestic demand. We witnessed a surge in data centre developments, propelled by the rapid adoption of AI and substantial investments from hyperscalers. The telecommunications sector felt the impact of shifting consumer expectations, with customers demanding faster, more reliable connectivity and user-friendly digital platforms.

Maxis has intensified efforts to connect communities and advance Malaysia's digital future. We expanded our reach, serving over 10.4 million RGS, extending services to over 780,000 homes and supporting enterprises. Our LTE network now covers 96% of the population, and 5G is a reality for all consumers and businesses, ensuring Malaysia remains competitive in a digital global landscape.

In 2024, we partnered with the Sarawak Digital Economy Corporation to accelerate digital transformation in Sarawak. This collaboration aims to expand connectivity and empower the local workforce with essential digital skills, aligning with the Sarawak Digital Economy Blueprint 2030.

In nurturing future talent, we strengthened our commitment in FY2024 through the Maxis Scholarship Programme, awarding 16 scholarships to outstanding students in STEM and digital technologies. Since its inception in 2006, the programme has supported and equipped 346 students with the skills to excel academically and in the workforce.

In 2024, we intensified our efforts to drive inclusion and create shared value for all stakeholders. Through initiatives such as eKelas®, we provide rural students with access to digital learning resources, bridging the educational divide. Our eKelas® Usahawan programme uplifts entrepreneurs and SMEs by equipping them with essential digital marketing skills.

We also launched the eKelas® Usahawan Advanced Programme, offering comprehensive training in soft and digital skills. This year, we facilitated the digital transformation of over 6,000 SME clients, enabling them to thrive in a digital marketplace.

In response to the devastating floods affecting communities across Malaysia, Maxis contributed RM5 million to the government's Dana Ihsan MADANI fund for relief efforts. We also provided immediate assistance by distributing 4,000 free mobile SIM cards and top-ups at temporary relief centres.

#### **DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE SHAREHOLDER RETURNS**

In recognition of our robust performance, the Board has declared an additional one-time dividend for Q4 2024, bringing the total dividend to 17 sen per share, with a total payout of RM1.3 billion for FY2024. We are committed to sustaining this growth trajectory in the coming year.

#### **UPHOLDING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**

In 2024, we continued to operate with integrity, fully complying with Bursa Securities' MMLR and maintaining strict adherence to anti-corruption laws. Our commitments are embedded in our Maxis Integrity and Compliance Framework and reinforced through our robust Anti-Money Laundering initiatives. We also assess Board members through the Maxis Anti-Bribery and Corruption system, ensuring that leadership at every level is aligned with our zero-tolerance stance on corruption.

I am pleased to report that we have maintained our ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems certification, reflecting our dedication to upholding the highest ethical standards.

### **CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT**

In an ever-evolving telecommunications landscape, staying ahead requires not only strong governance, but also continuous learning. Our Board of Directors is dedicated to keeping pace with global shifts and industry advancements through ongoing training, briefings and participation in leading international conferences and industry forums. These experiences enabled our leadership to be informed and agile, equipping us with the insights needed to navigate the complexities of a dynamic market.

At Maxis, our commitment to delivering long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders remains at the heart of everything we do.

As a result of our solid sustainability performance, Maxis was recognised by Bursa Securities, upgrading our FTSE4Good ESG rating from two stars to three stars. This acknowledgement reflects our enhanced disclosures and proactive initiatives across the sustainability spectrum, including stronger management of our supply chain.

**We grieve the passing of Mr. Ananda Krishnan Tatparanandam on 28 November 2024. His contributions to the development of Malaysia and the business world were substantial. Mr. Krishnan's philanthropy improved the lives of many and his wise guidance over the years helped steer Maxis to be the strong business it is today.**

#### **DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,**

**As we reflect on 2024, a year marked by significant achievements and dynamic market shifts, I am filled with pride in the resilience and unwavering dedication of the Maxis team. This year, as we celebrate our 30th anniversary, we have not only solidified our position as Malaysia's leading integrated telecommunications company, but also laid a strong foundation for continued growth and innovation.**

In a dynamic business environment shaped by intensified competition and evolving regulatory demands, we remained steadfast in our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our customers. Our focus on enhancing customer experience, coupled with strategic investments in our network and digital capabilities, yielded remarkable results. I am particularly pleased to report that we achieved our highest-ever service revenue of RM8.87 billion. Our EBITDA grew by 4.1% to RM4.12 billion, demonstrating our operational excellence and efficient resource management. This increase in profits is a direct result of our revenue growth and disciplined cost management. Operating free cash flow also improved by 8.6%, showcasing our improved working capital management.

We strategically focused our capital expenditure of RM674 million on enhancing our integrated network capabilities. Today, we have more than 11,000 LTE sites, covering 96% of Malaysia's population, and have connected over 500,000 premises with our fibre infrastructure. These investments are critical to ensuring we continue to provide seamless and reliable connectivity for all our customers.

In a year when the 5G landscape evolved, we remained agile and focused. While the recent award of the second 5G network has presented new challenges, we remain committed to exploring all avenues to enhance our 5G offerings. Our existing agreement with Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) ensures that our customers continue to enjoy 5G services, as we actively engage with stakeholders to shape our long-term 5G strategy. We are confident in our ability to navigate this evolving landscape and continue delivering exceptional value.

Our commitment to customer experience is paramount. We have enhanced digital self-service capabilities, integrated AI into our contact centre operations and utilised chatbots to improve efficiency. These initiatives have accelerated first-contact resolution, improved customer satisfaction and earned us multiple industry awards, including a Net Promoter Score of +70 and recognition among the top 20 leading customer experience companies in Malaysia.

Digitalisation is at the heart of our strategy. The successful transition to SAP S4/HANA, deployment of our proprietary AI platform, Dexter, as well as implementation of advanced analytics and machine learning tools have significantly enhanced our operational efficiency and customer experience. We have also prioritised building agile and competent digital talent, earning us the Coursera Regional Award for business impact in 2024.

We strengthened our value proposition to shareholders by prioritising operating excellence, streamlining processes and maintaining strict cost discipline. Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in our upgraded FTSE4Good ESG Rating and we have continued to strengthen our network's emissions efficiency and e-waste initiatives.

Strategic partnerships remain critical to our success. Our collaborations with major tech companies, network equipment vendors and telco peers around the region have enhanced our capabilities and expanded our service offerings, allowing us to deliver innovative solutions to our customers.

Looking ahead to 2025, we will focus on growing and securing our consumer subscriber base, expanding our enterprise business and continuing to digitalise our operations. We will also prioritise operating excellence and expanding our fibre infrastructure. In addition, we are excited about launching Maxis Home Solar, part of our bundled home propositions.

As we celebrate our 30th anniversary, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated staff members, loyal customers, steadfast shareholders and valued partners for their unwavering support. I also warmly welcome Datuk Johan bin Idris as our new Chairman. His extensive experience will be invaluable as we embark on our next chapter of growth.

Thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Maxis. We are committed to delivering sustainable value and making 2025 our most successful year yet.

### **FINANCIAL REVIEW**

#### **INVESTOR RELATIONS**

#### **Dividend Policy**

Our full dividend policy, as stated in our IPO Prospectus dated 28 October 2009, is reproduced here for reference:

"The declaration of interim dividends and the recommendation of final dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board and any final dividend for the year is subject to shareholders' approval. It is the Company's intention to pay dividends to shareholders in the future. However, such payments will depend upon a number of factors, including Maxis' earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, the Company's distributable reserves and other factors considered relevant by the Board.

Maxis intends to adopt a dividend policy of active capital management. The Company proposes to pay dividends out of cash generated by its operations after setting aside necessary funding for network expansion and improvement and working capital needs. As part of this policy, the Company targets a payout ratio of not less than 75% of its consolidated PAT under Malaysian Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAP) in each calendar year, beginning financial year ending 31 December 2010, subject to confirmation of the Board and to any applicable law, license and contractual obligations and provided that such distribution would not be detrimental to its cash needs or to any plans approved by its Board. Investors should note that this dividend policy merely describes the Company's present intention and shall not constitute legally binding statements in respect of the Company's future dividends which are subject to modification (including reduction or non-declaration thereof) at the Board's discretion."

The reported PAT payout ratios in the financial years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were 101.8%, 132.6%, 126.3% and 95.4%, respectively.

### **OUR MATERIAL MATTERS**

We conduct our materiality assessment regularly to ensure we remain agile and responsive to emerging sustainability trends, regulatory shifts and industry developments that influence our business operations.

This assessment also helps us identify and focus on the most critical economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) matters, ensuring they are integrated with our corporate strategy and aligned with the expectations of our stakeholders.

As part of our 2024 materiality assessment process, we engaged both internal and external stakeholders through a comprehensive survey to gather insights on the sustainability issues that are most relevant to Maxis and the interest of its stakeholders.

We then conducted a prioritisation and validation exercise with Maxis Management Team (MMT) to gather their perspectives and rank inputs on the identified material matters.

We also benchmarked our material matters against industry peers and referenced key local and international frameworks, including Bursa Securities' Sustainability Reporting Guide (3rd Edition), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Topic Standards, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and UN SDGs.

Additionally, we conducted desktop research on sustainability and sector trends, where we incorporated insights from the 2024 Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) material sustainability issues and the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) strategic plan for the mobile sector.

The outcome of the assessment was a prioritised list of material matters, evaluated and prioritised based on their importance to our stakeholders and the potential impact of EESG on Maxis.

Our materiality assessment process is depicted below:

#### **Step 1**

![](_page_20_Picture_14.jpeg)

• Engaged key internal stakeholders to align on the objectives and scope of the materiality assessment exercise for FY2024.

#### **Step 2**

**Identify Potential Material EESG Topics and Key Stakeholders**

- Created a list of potential material topics relevant to Maxis by performing desktop research on external sources of information, including trends analysis and media review, peer benchmarking, regulatory requirements and industry frameworks and standards.
- Our methodology was guided by and made reference to the following standards:
	- i. Bursa Securities' MMLR on sustainability reporting (i.e. 11 common material topics);
	- ii. GRI Topic Standards;
	- iii. SASB; and
	- iv. UN SDGs.

**Prioritisation of Material Matters**

**Step 3**

- Engaged representatives from key internal and external stakeholder groups to capture perspectives on identified material matters via materiality assessment survey questionnaires.
- The survey questionnaires sought to gather input and prioritise material topics based on:
	- i. The level of influence and dependence on each stakeholder group;
	- ii. The level of importance of each material topic to each stakeholder group; and
	- iii. The impact and likelihood of occurrence of each material topic.

#### **Step 4**

**Validation of Material Matters** 

• Validated the materiality assessment outcomes with key Senior Management, incorporating their perspectives on the positioning of material matters, which were then refined to ensure relevance and strategic alignment to Maxis' priorities, the telecommunications industry landscape and stakeholder expectations.

All material matters identified in FY2023 remain pertinent in FY2024, with Employee Health, Safety & Well-being renamed to better align with industry standards and reflect employee-centric priorities.

Network Quality & Coverage, Customer Experience & Satisfaction and Data Privacy & Protection continue to rank as the top material matters, underscoring Maxis' unwavering commitment to delivering reliable connectivity, elevating customer experiences and safeguarding data in an increasingly digital landscape. Sustainable Business Growth also remains a highpriority material matter, highlighting Maxis' strategic focus on long-term resilience, digital transformation and financial sustainability.

While the rankings of other material matters have shifted slightly, they continue to play a role in Maxis' sustainability approach, supporting its business objectives and stakeholder expectations. Maxis remains committed to continuously evaluating and refining its material matters to stay aligned with industry dynamics and stakeholder expectations.

#### **KEY BUSINESS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**

Maxis is affected by multiple risks, triggered by internal and external events, such as 5G implementation, changes to regulatory landscape and reporting requirement, competitive pricing, spectrum allocation and geopolitics.

To help us in identifying and assessing the relevant Sustainability risks, we have integrated our Sustainability risk into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Additional details about our business risk identification and prioritisation process are explained in the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control.

#### **ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT M15**

#### **Why It Matters**

Environmental management is essential to ensuring the long-term sustainability of Maxis, while minimising our impact on the planet. As a responsible organisation, we recognise the need to mitigate environmental risks and comply with regulations, including conducting Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) where necessary.

Effective waste management helps us reduce hazardous waste, promote circularity and responsibly handle e-waste to conserve resources and prevent pollution.

Our forest reserve construction approach is to obtain permits from the Forestry Department and conduct joint site visits for tree impact assessments. For wildlife and biodiversity conservation, Maxis strictly prohibits independent removal of wildlife. We seek assistance from Jabatan Bomba to protect or rehabilitate wildlife nesting on towers or otherwise.

#### **Our Approach**

We adopt a comprehensive approach to environmental management by implementing an ISO 14001:2015-certified Environmental Management System (EMS) for the operation and maintenance of our Technical Operation Centre (TOC) facilities at Subang Hitech. This approach focuses identifying and managing environmental impacts, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and promoting sustainable practices across its operations.

Our Subang Hitech TOC was the first telecommunications network site in Malaysia to receive this certification from SIRIM QAS International.

We are also committed to full compliance with local environmental laws and regulations. As part of our dedication to environmental stewardship, we are systematically implementing EMS at selected operational sites.

This includes conducting both internal and external environmental audits at EMS-certified locations and focusing on corrective measures to mitigate any environmental impact.

In 2024, we implemented waste management protocols tailored to Maxis' waste streams to enhance recycling rates, while aligning with global industry standards.

#### **Our Progress & Performance in 2024**

Our commitment to enabling circularity includes responsible waste management and the reduction of hazardous waste sent to landfills, supported by targeted initiatives and ongoing progress monitoring.

#### **Network Equipment**

We have implemented structured processes for managing scheduled waste, including electrical and electronic assemblies, within our network operations. To ensure the proper collection and disposal of e-waste, we engage authorised waste collectors.

We prioritise the responsible management of copper cables by collaborating with our partner to separate, melt and repurpose the material for resale. Additionally, the remaining thermoplastic materials from copper cables are repurposed to manufacture new products, used as packing materials or recycled. We are also strengthening our approach to scheduled waste disposal. The Network division implements a standardised process for handling electrical and electronic assemblies, ensuring compliance with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems.

We are also reusing decommissioned equipment and its parts for ongoing projects to minimise scrap. Decommissioned equipment like Remote Radio Units (RRUs), is repurposed, maximising resource utilisation. In 2024, 325 RRU units were replaced using decommissioned equipment, reducing the need for new replacements and lowering costs.

In FY2024, our waste management initiatives resulted in an 88% recycling rate for network waste. This outcome was supported by effective waste segregation, resource recovery and collaboration with licensed recyclers. We also ensured compliance with the Department of Environment of Malaysia (DOE) regulations by categorising waste under SW110 (Electrical and Electronic Assemblies) and SW102 (waste with heavy metals). Through strengthened waste tracking and targeted waste diversion initiatives, we aim to reduce landfill dependency and promote circularity.

Looking ahead, we are committed to refining our waste management strategies further to reduce landfill dependency and promote circularity.

#### **Office Waste**

For the eighth consecutive year, we partnered with Community Recycle for Charity (CRC), a non-governmental organisation, to recycle our office waste and contribute to charitable fundraising.

To enhance employee waste segregation behaviours, Maxis launched an awareness campaign, titled "Office Waste Separation Starts With You," incorporating awareness videos, ensuring that waste management is a shared responsibility at all levels.

An equal opportunity workforce is key to Maxis' business strategy, as it ensures that all employees, regardless of background, have access to the same opportunities for growth, development and career progression based on their skills, performance and potential.

Moving forward, we aim to enhance the assessment and reporting of human rights violations across our supply chain.

#### **MOVING FORWARD**

We will continue to reinforce our approach and deepen collaborations to promote overall social and economic empowerment, reaffirming our commitment to fostering impactful and enduring change throughout our local communities. Our short-term approach involves fine-tuning our engagement strategies, improving programme delivery and increasing participation opportunities in community initiatives. Over the medium term, we will strengthen partnerships, roll out structured mentorship programmes and capability development measures, as well as offer continuous support to beneficiaries. Long-term plans include prioritising measurable outcomes, amplifying our efforts to maximise national impact and make social responsibility central to our strategy.

#### **GOVERNANCE**

At Maxis, we are dedicated to cultivating a work environment where every employee can thrive. We foster a culture of collaboration, continuous learning and empowerment, while remaining committed to providing equal opportunities. By attracting, retaining and developing top talent, we drive innovation and success across our organisation. Additionally, we invest in the communities around us, leveraging technology to create empowerment opportunities and drive positive change. By embedding responsible business practices into our operations, we ensure sustainable growth and long-term value for all our stakeholders.

#### **CRISIS MANAGEMENT & RESPONSE**

#### **Why It Matters**

Crisis management and response are essential to ensuring Maxis' ability to maintain uninterrupted services during disruptions. A strong crisis management framework safeguards operations, preserves customer trust and protects stakeholder interests. Failure to have an effective strategy in place could lead to operational downtime, revenue loss, reputational damage and diminished stakeholder confidence, impacting business continuity and long-term resilience.

#### **Our Approach**

Our approach is centred around a structured Business Continuity Management (BCM) framework that is aligned with the ISO 22301 standard. This framework includes a formalised BCM policy that identifies and prioritises essential business functions, conducts risk assessments and develops effective continuity strategies. Furthermore, Crisis Management Teams (CMTs) are in place to manage incidents, supported by regular Business Impact Analyses (BIA) and Risk Assessments (RA) to identify vulnerabilities and optimise resource allocation. We also conduct routine testing and scenario-based drills to assess preparedness, while we continue to strengthen monitoring capabilities and leverage analytics to enhance early risk detection and mitigation to ensure swift response measures and operational resilience.

We continue to enhance our crisis management capabilities through BCM awareness, trainings, technology adoption, regulatory compliance and ongoing improvements.

#### **Crisis Management**

We have put in place a plan where, in the event of a crisis, the Disaster Recovery Director will lead the team in handling the crisis, with the CMT coordinating responses across divisions. The Crisis Council is then activated to guide decision-making, ensuring a structured and efficient crisis resolution process. A designated spokesperson is appointed to manage external communications, ensuring consistent and transparent messaging. A statement will also be issued to keep stakeholders informed on the matter.

#### **M7 Regulatory Compliance and Risk Mitigation**

We also coordinate with the MCMC and the National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA) to ensure compliance with crisis management regulations. One such example would be cybersecurity attacks targeting critical IT and telecommunications network systems. In this regard, these threats are managed through the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which systematically identifies, assesses and integrates risks into business operations to minimise potential disruptions.

#### **Continuous Improvements and Review Processes**

We conduct regular updates and post-mortem reviews to refine response protocols and strengthen future readiness. Internal audits and ISO audits are conducted periodically to assess and enhance the effectiveness of crisis management processes, ensuring continuous improvement in our risk mitigation and response strategies.

#### **Performance**

Our crisis management protocols are designed to respond swiftly, minimising disruptions and maintaining a significant focus on customer experience. This approach underscores the importance of timely communication with internal teams and external stakeholders for a well-coordinated response.

#### **MOVING FORWARD**

We will continue to enhance our crisis management and response resilience by investing in AI-driven predictive analytics to enhance our crisis detection capabilities. Our BCM efforts will also be aligned with sustainability goals to address climate-related risks. The BCM Steering Committee will continue to oversee these initiatives, ensuring strong governance and continuous improvement in crisis management strategies.

### **GOVERNANCE**

#### **DATA PRIVACY & PROTECTION M4**

#### **Why It Matters**

The management of personal data is critical to Maxis, as it is essential to business operations and stakeholder trust. As a telecommunications provider, we handle personal data from subscribers, employees, directors, third parties and stakeholders, making data privacy and security a key priority. Failure to manage personal data effectively could result in regulatory non-compliance, legal penalties, financial losses and reputational damage, impacting customer confidence, employee morale and market position. To mitigate these risks, we implement stringent data protection measures and adhere to regulatory requirements, ensuring compliance while reinforcing stakeholder trust and supporting long-term business sustainability.

#### **Our Approach**

Our approach to data privacy and protection is built on a structured programme that ensures compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA), the Personal Data Protection Code of Practice for the Communications Sector 2017 and other relevant regulations. As a public listed company, we uphold the highest standards of data protection and adhere to stringent reporting requirements, ensuring transparency in our data protection practices and incident reporting.

This programme upholds data security and privacy while enabling individuals to maintain control over their personal data. A dedicated Data Privacy Office (DPO) oversees its implementation, ensuring that all measures are effectively managed and aligned with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we comply with internationally recognised standards and certifications, holding ISO 27001 certification for core telecom network components and sites, as well as ISO 27017 and ISO 27018 certifications for public cloud-hosted, customer-facing applications that process customer personal data. To further strengthen cybersecurity measures, we also maintain a Cybersecurity Service Provider licence under the National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA).

#### **Our Progress & Performance in 2024**

#### **Data Privacy and Protection Programme**

This programme encompasses:

#### **Policies and Procedures**

We have developed a Data Privacy and Protection Standard Operating Policies and Procedures (SOPP) covering all aspects of data processing across the Group. These SOPP are regularly updated in response to changes in data protection laws and organisational adjustments affecting relevant entities and divisions.

#### **PDPA Compliance Awareness and Training**

As part of our digitisation efforts, we launched a Personal Data Privacy and Protection compliance training through Maxis Academy in September 2022. This training is continuously refreshed to align with evolving data protection laws and serves as an annual refresher for employees from 2023 to 2024. Additionally, we provide tailored training sessions for exclusive distributors, dealers, Hotlink Foot Soldiers (HFSs) and Hotlink Independent Agents (HIAs) to ensure all stakeholders understand their responsibilities in handling personal data.

#### **Incident and Breach Response Team**

The DPO plays a key role in the Incident and Breach Response Team, overseeing investigations and assessments of data privacy incidents. A dedicated privacy hotline email (privacy@maxis.com.my) is available for employees and external parties to report incidents, enabling the DPO to respond promptly.

#### **Legal Monitoring and Gap Analysis**

The DPO continuously monitors new data protection laws and conducts gap analysis to identify compliance issues. As a representative of the Telco Forum, Maxis participated in a cross-industry engagement sessions with the Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Digital, the Personal Data Protection Commission and Futurise Sdn. Bhd., a government-linked think tank for emerging technology regulations. Following these discussions, updates were shared with the Telco Forum to ensure industry-wide preparedness.

In 2024, Maxis submitted feedback on five Public Consultation Papers, covering topics such as:

- The Implementation of Data Breach Notification
- Appointment of Data Protection Officers
- The Right to Data Portability
- Personal Data Protection Standards
- Cross-Border Personal Data Transfers

#### **Compliance Monitoring**

The DPO conducts regular compliance checks to ensure adherence to data protection laws and Maxis SOPP.

#### **Stakeholder Communication and Incident Reporting**

The DPO team works closely with Customer Operations, Cybersecurity, Data & AI and Legal to investigate and manage any alleged data privacy breaches to ensure that all reported incidents are assessed and addressed effectively.

#### **Cybersecurity**

At Maxis, enhancing cyber resilience remains a top priority as cyber threats grow more sophisticated. Our focus is on anticipating, withstanding, recovering from, and adapting to cyberattacks that target our systems and customer data.

In 2024, cybersecurity is rapidly evolving, with AI-driven threat detection, zero trust architecture and cloud-native security becoming essential to a strong defence strategy. We align with these advancements through our three strategic cybersecurity pillars:

- i. Protecting the Brand and Ensuring Compliance
- ii. Embedding Security in Our DNA
- iii. Strengthening Cyber Resilience

Maxis actively collaborates with regulators such as MCMC and NACSA to support national cybersecurity initiatives. Through strategic partnerships and a proactive security framework, we stay ahead of emerging threats, safeguarding our networks, applications and customer data, while driving our digital transformation forward.

#### **Upcoming Regulatory Changes and Compliance Preparations**

In 2025, we will implement the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2024 in three phases (January, April and June). In preparation for the implementation, we are working closely with relevant departments to enhance our policies and procedures for personal data handling across all operations.

#### **Ongoing Risk Assessments and Strengthening Security Compliance**

Maxis conducts regular risk assessments to identify compliance gaps and enhance our data protection framework. Our DPO team continuously updates policies and monitors emerging risks to ensure robust safeguards and compliance with evolving regulations.

We have achieved key milestones in security compliance, including the renewal of our ISO 27001 certification for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) across Cloud Infrastructure, Voice and Data Networks, Enterprise Managed Services and Key Data Centres without any noncompliances. Audited by SIRIM, this certification reflects our strong security policies and controls. Additionally, we maintain PCI DSS compliance to ensure stringent protection of customer payment systems and data.

Beyond certifications, we actively engage the security community through our Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP) and Bug Bounty initiatives, rewarding ethical hackers for responsibly identifying vulnerabilities.

By adhering to global best practices and fostering strategic partnerships, Maxis ensures continuous security enhancements and customer confidence in our compliance and data protection measures.

#### **Strengthening Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Awareness**

We continued to push for data privacy and protection awareness through mandatory annual refresher training on the PDPA, which is conducted via Maxis Academy. While PDPA awareness and training are not extended to thirdparty vendors, we provide tailored training sessions to the Consumer Business Division's Compliance Team, which oversees the onboarding and compliance of Maxis' exclusive distributors, dealers, HFSs and HIAs.

**The effectiveness of these training programmes resulted in** ZERO **substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data in 2023 and 2024.**

**In total,** 5,695 **employees received data privacy and protection training in 2024.** 

Cybersecurity awareness remains a key focus, with all employees required to complete annual refresher training under the Data Privacy and Protection module. Additionally, Maxis Academy organised AWS Security Jams and facilitated external training and certifications for our employees, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) and ISO Lead Auditor. The training sessions cover key topics such as fake base transceiver stations (BTS), threat hunting and AI security to strengthen employees' cybersecurity capabilities.

In 2024, no critical severity cybersecurity incidents were observed. There was a significant improvement of 78.3% in average time to close security incidents compared to 2023. This was achieved through improvements in incident response playbooks as well as proactive threat hunting. We also discovered a fivefold increase in fake applications, URLs and malicious websites and performed takedown to protect Maxis and our customers.

Furthermore, we increased the total number of vulnerabilities remediated or mitigated by 35.6% when compared to 2023. A risk assessment and exemption process is in place for cases requiring additional time for patching, upgrade, migration, or system decommissioning.

### **GOVERNANCE**

#### **Strengthening Cyber Resilience While Driving Digital Innovation**

Maxis continues to fortify cyber resilience while enabling innovation through standardised cybersecurity controls, zero trust architecture and AI-driven security frameworks. Collaborating with business teams, we launched a cloudbased Security Operations Centre (SOC) pilot to enhance threat monitoring and response.

We expanded prevention and detection capabilities across cloud infrastructure, identity and access management, endpoint security and network threat detection, ensuring critical access points remain secure. Recognising rising cloud-native vulnerabilities and API security risks, we strengthened cloud security guardrails and API assessments to mitigate emerging threats.

Through proactive threat hunting, real-time intelligence sharing and machine learning-based anomaly detection, we successfully prevented potential attacks before they materialised. Embedding security by design into new projects further ensures compliance and robust protection from the outset.

As cyber threats evolve, our strategy remains proactive and technology-driven, leveraging next-gen security innovations to safeguard our digital ecosystem and support business growth.

### **MOVING FORWARD**

Maxis remains focused on mitigating potential risks related to data privacy and compliance through continuous monitoring and proactive measures. We will also collaborate with the Risk Management team to actively track and address any significant gaps in compliance with the PDPA.

### **M6 ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES**

### **Why It Matters**

At Maxis, we believe upholding ethical standards strengthens corporate governance, enhances our reputation and builds stakeholder trust. Furthermore, integrating integrity and transparency into our ESG strategies supports long-term value creation, resilience and sustained business competitiveness in the telecommunications and digital services industry.

#### **Our Approach**

Our approach is centred around adhering to the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS), Maxis Anti-Bribery & Corruption (ABC) Policy, Maxis Anti-Bribery and Corruption System (MABC) and Maxis Integrity and Compliance Framework (MICF). The overall effectiveness and implementation of the MABC has also been enhanced due to the ISO37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System certification obtained in November 2022. The Board of Directors, top management and personnel have demonstrated a strong commitment to upholding a zerotolerance policy on bribery and corruption. As a result, Maxis has decided to proceed with the recertification of ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System.

### **Our Progress & Performance in 2024**

In response to emerging risks, the Integrity and Governance Unit (IGU) implemented several initiatives in 2024 to strengthen anti-corruption controls and enhance governance measures. These initiatives include but are not limited to:

- Third Party Integrity Statement
- Due Diligence Policy Statement
- Simplified Vendor Onboarding Process
- Enhancement to Procurement Process: Tendering Guidelines
- Strengthened controls for refund excess and terminated accounts to minimise AML/CFT risks
- Enhanced Government Partner Onboarding Framework
- Updated Sponsorship and Donations Policy
- Amendment to MICF to align with the #SimplyMaxis culture blueprint
- Integrated climate-related risks into the MAXIS ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System Manual, covering regulatory compliance, supply chain vulnerabilities and resource allocation for climate initiatives

#### **Updating MICF**

The updated MICF approved by the Board on 7 November 2024, aligns with the #SimplyMaxis Culture Blueprint. Based on the Guidelines on Adequate Procedures and Section 17A(5) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act 2009, the framework retains core components supporting AML/CFT measures, ethical guidelines and regular compliance training. Governance accountability remains with the Board.

Annual bribery and corruption risk reviews, conducted with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), assess existing controls. In 2024, 12 ABMS and bribery and corruption risk review sessions were held across divisions.

Mandatory training sessions on Maxis' Code of Business Practice (CoBP) and Anti-Bribery and Corruption policies strengthen ethical conduct.

CRM is our strategy to mitigate bribery risks within our organisation. It entails assessing the associated risks, reviewing our policies and procedures and implementing robust anti-bribery measures.

Our CRM procedures not only identify structural vulnerabilities that may lead to corruption, but also encourage active employee participation in identifying potential risk factors and proposing effective mitigation strategies.

### **GOVERNANCE**

#### **Maxis Integrity Corporate Advocacy Programme (MICAP) 2024**

In 2024, MICAP held two key events: Integrity Matters Day and Security & Safety Day 2024.

- **Integrity Matters Day**, featured Integrity Culture Matters led by Nurirdzuana Ismail, Head of IGU, followed by Leader Speaks Integrity with ARC Chairman, Mr. Uthaya Kumar A/L K Vivekananda. Distinguished speakers included Datuk Mohamad Zamri Zainul Abidin (MACC) and Mr. Vickram Ragunath (UNODC). The event also highlighted Maxis Young Talent, Siti Sarah Mohammed Suhaimi.
- **Security & Safety Day 2024**, held on 23-24 July 2024, featured talks by Nurirdzuana Ismail, Head of IGU, on compliance and integrity, and encouragement to use ethics hotlines. On 24 July 2024, IGU and MACC booths offered interactive activities like ʻSpin the Wheel of Integrity', policy quizzes and insights on corporate liability. The MACC booth provided briefings, posters and videos, raising employee awareness of national anti-corruption efforts.

#### **MOVING FORWARD**

We will conduct frequent risk assessments, enhance training programmes, engage stakeholders to promote transparency, integrate ESG principles, maintain the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) and explore youth engagement programmes to mitigate potential risks related to bribery and corruption.

#### **M11 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT**

#### **Why It Matters**

A sustainable supply chain is essential to Maxis' long-term success, ensuring business resilience while minimising environmental impact and creating positive social value. By maintaining responsible sourcing practices and ethical supplier relationships, it strengthens Maxis' operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

#### **Our Approach**

Maxis manages its supply chain through a structured framework guided by the Maxis Procurement Policy. The policy defines the supplier onboarding, sourcing, selection and evaluation processes, with suppliers assessed based on technical and commercial criteria. To mitigate risks, periodic procurement risk assessments are conducted to identify potential disruptions and ensure suppliers meet Maxis' operational standards. To uphold its zero-tolerance policy on unethical business conduct, Maxis requires all procurement vendors to acknowledge the Maxis Code of Business Practice (MCOBP) for Third Parties and sign the Integrity Pledge Statement. Additionally, all employees must complete mandatory annual training on the Maxis Code of Conduct in relation to ethical business practices.

#### **Our Progress & Performance in 2024**

#### **Upholding Procurement Compliance and Supplier Integrity**

Maxis upholds the highest standards of ethical business practices across all supplier engagements. Our suppliers must adhere to socially, legally and ethically responsible practices, as outlined in the Maxis Code of Business Practice (MCOBP) for Third Parties and the Third-Party Integrity Pledge Statement, both mandatory for vendor onboarding.

Our team ensures transparency and professionalism in procurement by following the Maxis Procurement Policy, Guidelines and Maxis Code of Conduct, protecting confidentiality and preventing conflicts of interest.

Our procurement policies set a clear benchmark for operational excellence in quality and cost, ensuring that suppliers exceed such expectations. We foster strong partnerships through a robust supplier engagement strategy.

Maxis promotes compliance through the Vendor Integrity Programme and regular training by our Integrity and Governance Unit (IGU). Training materials in multiple languages are available on Maxis' vendor portal and official YouTube channel, reinforcing our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption.

#### **Enhancing Procurement Efficiency Through Digital Solutions**

In 2024, Maxis enhanced its e-sourcing digital platform by implementing an e-ticketing system to monitor sourcing and contract requests, automating technical evaluations in the tendering process, enhancing digital contracting processes to further eliminate manual intervention and integrating it with Maxis' ERP system.

#### **Strengthening Supplier Performance and Engagement**

Maxis launched the Vendor Performance Evaluation (VPE) on 8 January 2024, assessing 362 contracts from 252 vendors. The evaluation showed that 89% of the vendors met or exceeded the baseline score of 80%. Areas identified for improvement included project management efficiency, timely submission of documentation and more proactive communication on issue resolution.

To strengthen supplier engagement, the VPE results were shared with vendors and regular meetings were held with strategic suppliers. Contract owners reviewed performance, set KPIs and worked with suppliers to address challenges. Regular audits were in place to identify gaps and ensure compliance with Maxis' procurement standards.

#### **Managing Supply Chain Risks**

We identified key supply chain risks, especially the impact of global and local events on critical materials and services. To mitigate these risks, we monitored market conditions, maintained continuous communication with suppliers and explored alternative sourcing to ensure continuity and minimise disruptions.

In 2024, we allocated RM7.1 billion to suppliers, with the breakdown as follows:

**Proportion of our spending by supplier nationality (spend and %):**

- **- Local: RM6.1 billion (86%)**
- **- Foreign: RM1.0 billion (14%)**

**In 2024, Maxis onboarded 165 vendors, all of whom underwent the vendor onboarding process and met the necessary requirements for compliance and operational standards under Maxis' procurement policies, including the due diligence process.**

#### **MOVING FORWARD**

We are continuously exploring automation and digitalisation to further enhance our procurement process for enhanced transparency, efficiency and controls. Our e-sourcing digital platform has enabled us to focus more on category management to meet business requirements.

To achieve this, we have outlined:

#### **Short-Term plans: 1-2 years**

- Promote standardised contract management framework.
- Further automation and potential utilisation of AI capability to enhance operational efficiency.

#### **Medium-Term plans: 2-5 years**

- Broaden procurement coverage.
- Support Maxis' sustainability ambition and commitment in relation to supply chain.

#### **Long-Term plans: 5 years and beyond**

- Explore more strategic partnerships with key suppliers to enable productive and mutually beneficial collaboration.
- Supply chain automation to optimise sourcing, logistics, inventory management and supplier collaboration.

#### **M5 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE**

#### **Why It Matters**

Maxis maintains a strong and cooperative relationship with the Minister of Communications, who sets broad communications industry policies, the Ministry of Communications and with the MCMC who as the regulator plays a key role across licensing, spectrum allocation, industry practices, wholesale access pricing, standards and compliance. This entails positioning Maxis as a responsible operator that delivers high-quality affordable services while complying with Malaysia's regulatory framework. By managing this relationship effectively, Maxis can foster a conducive operating environment and strengthen its longterm position.

At Maxis, we uphold the highest standards of governance in our engagements with federal and state governments. Our collaborations are guided by strict adherence to our Government and Regulatory Engagement Policy and Procedure, which is centred around the principles of transparency and accountability.

#### **Our Approach**

We conduct structured dialogues and present fact based submissions, engage open discussions and thought leadership sessions on key topics that support the national agenda.

Internal processes are continuously refined to maintain compliance with existing and newly introduced regulations. Ongoing dialogue with internal stakeholders ensures that relevant teams are well-informed about their regulatory obligations. Training sessions and awareness initiatives are conducted to reinforce compliance requirements, particularly in areas with evolving regulatory frameworks such as cybersecurity and quality of service standards. Additionally, internal monitoring mechanisms and audits provide a structured approach to assessing compliance, identifying risks and implementing necessary remedial actions.

#### **Progress & Performance**

In 2024, Maxis navigated several regulatory changes, including the stricter provisions under the revised Mandatory Standards on Quality of Service for Wireless Broadband Access and on cybersecurity compliance. We adapted swiftly to these requirements, ensuring operational readiness before the new regulations took effect.

Internal training sessions were carried out to align employees with regulatory changes, including the revised General Consumer Code. These sessions were well attended by employees across multiple functions, ensuring that frontline teams, including customer service and credit management, were equipped to comply with the updated requirements.

Throughout the year, Maxis maintained an active engagement with MCMC on a range of industry issues, including network rollout improvements, market competition, spectrum and consumer protection measures. Compliance audits were conducted both internally and externally to ensure standards were met.

#### **MOVING FORWARD**

Maxis will continue to focus on strengthening engagements with the Ministry of Communications, the MCMC and other relevant authorities to foster a collaborative regulatory environment. Maxis will also continue to foster a strong compliance culture, ensuring that regulatory adherence is integrated into its broader business strategy. Investments in infrastructure expansion, particularly in rural connectivity, will align with national digitalisation goals while ensuring compliance with evolving service quality standards.

#### **BOARD COMPOSITION**

The Board comprises market and industry leaders, cutting across multiple fields, who accordingly serve as Independent Non-Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. In 2024, the Board comprised of eight (8) Directors, of whom 50% (4 out of 8) are Independent Non-Executive Directors.

Directors' profiles are set out on pages 60 to 64 while the Board Composition overview can be found on page 59 of this IAR.

The Board believes its composition and size are suitable for its responsibilities due to its diverse qualifications and governance structure.

Independent Non-Executive Directors are crucial for providing unbiased opinions and ensuring the interests of the Group and its stakeholders are well-represented.

Details of the independence assessment are set out in the Statement of the NRC on pages 76 to 79 of this IAR.

The NRC makes independent recommendations for selection and appointments to the Board, based on criteria which they develop, maintain and review based on applicable laws and regulations.

The NRC will review the gap analysis based on the existing Board composition such as optimum size, and diversity in terms of skills, experience, age, gender, knowledge and independence, having regard to the strategic direction of our Company. This then forms the proposed selection criteria.

The search process for potential candidates may include recommendations from existing Directors, Management, major shareholders, industry and professional associations, open advertisements or independent executive search firms. The NRC reviews and considers candidate(s) with reference to the agreed selection criteria and conducts engagement sessions with the shortlisted candidate(s) as well as the fit and proper assessment, before submitting its final recommendation to the Board.

### **COMPANY SECRETARY**

The Board is supported by the Company Secretary who is qualified to act as company secretary under the CA 2016. The Company Secretary acts as advisor to the Board to facilitate overall compliance with the MMLR, CA 2016 and applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Board members have full access to the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary ensures that the Directors are provided with sufficient information and time to prepare for Board and/or Committee meetings. To this, the meeting materials are made accessible to the Directors on their devices within reasonable periods prior to the meetings. The Company Secretary also ensures the minutes of meetings are prepared in a timely manner and the records are well documented while she concurrently communicates with Management on the action items and facilitates follow-up requests, decisions or recommendations from the Board.

The Company Secretary constantly keeps herself abreast of the progressing and everchanging regulatory landscape and corporate governance development through continuous trainings.

#### **INDUCTION AND SUCCESSION PLANNING**

Maxis ensures that new Directors undergo a comprehensive on-boarding programme to familiarise themselves and understand the Group's business strategy, operations and governance.

The Board via NRC actively monitors and evaluates the tenure of Directors, including Independent Directors, to provide Board members the opportunity to reassess their memberships as part of its succession planning and Board refresh. Succession planning remains a priority in Maxis in ensuring there is a steady pool of talent to fill the vacancies at the Board and Senior Management levels.

### **BOARD AND DIRECTORS' EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION (BDEE)**

Practice 6.1 of the MCCG recommends that the Board undertakes an annual BDEE. During the year, the Institute of Corporate Directors Malaysia (ICDM) was engaged by the Board to facilitate an independent BDEE in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2024. The BDEE evaluated the effectiveness of the Board based on ICDM's 10 competency parameters and compliance with the various regulatory requirements and guidelines applicable to Maxis. A two (2) pronged focus conducted by ICDM for the BDEE, were:

- (i) Overall Board Effectiveness Evaluation, that included review of all Board Committees; and
- (ii) Individual Directors Evaluation.

### **Overall Board Evaluation**

The Board of Maxis was led by a respected Interim Chairman who demonstrated effective leadership and upheld corporate governance standards. The Board works harmoniously, fostering trust, openness, and respect among members and Management. They engage in open discussions and consensus-driven decision-making, maintaining strong governance and adhering to processes. Overall, the Board meets expectations of a well-performing organisation, with no major concerns regarding its effectiveness. However, there are areas for improvement, such as prioritising a Board succession plan based on the Board competency/skills matrix and Board development, and revisiting the Company's sustainability strategies, priorities, and targets.

Details of the BDEE are provided in the CG Report under Practice 6.1.

#### **TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF DIRECTORS**

Paragraph 15.08 and Practice Note 5 of the MMLR

Directors regularly attend talks, briefings, workshops and utilise online learning tools and reading materials to keep apprised of operational, legal, regulatory and industry matters in the discharge of their duties. The NRC and the Board assess the training needs of each Director on an ongoing basis, by determining areas that would best strengthen his/her contributions to the Board.

Amongst others, the Directors of the Company, attended various trainings on gaming publishing and its business, IT and Network overview for the telco industry, uses of AI in the telco industry, cyber security, data centres, sustainability and ESG, governance matters and operational matters.

#### **REMUNERATION**

The Board has instituted a set of policies and procedures to govern the remuneration of Directors. Non-Executive Directors receive remuneration that commensurate with their responsibilities on the Board as well as on the Board Committees and it is designed to attract, incentivise, and retain high-performing individuals.

The Board, through the NRC, undertook relevant assessments and recommended for DHN to continue to serve as an Independent Non-Executive Director from 18 May 2025 until 31 January 2026, after which she will reach her twelve (12)-year tenure as an Independent Director and would no longer be regarded as an Independent Director pursuant to the MMLR.

#### **Note:**

DHN has abstained from deliberation and voting at the relevant NRC and Board meetings in respect of the recommendation on her continuation to act as an Independent Director of the Company

The NRC and Board's recommendations are based on the following justifications:

- (i) DHN has fulfilled the criteria of an Independent Director as stated in the MMLR. She has demonstrated her objectivity and independence both in substance and form. DHN is not hesitant to challenge the rest of the Board members and Management team while discharging her responsibilities as a Director and previously as Interim Chairman (from 1 July 2024 to 28 February 2025), and when considering Board/Committee matters.
- (ii) DHN is free from any conflicts of interest. As an Independent Director, Chairman of the NRC, and Member of the ARC, DHN provides constructive independent counsel to the Board Committees and Board, and guidance to Management in the best interests of Maxis.
- (iii) DHN with her expertise in human resources, people management, governance, and corporate social responsibility, brings invaluable insights to the Board. Her extensive cross-industry experience enables her to offer practical counsel, oversight, and strategic guidance in Board and Committee matters. Her impartial insights are crucial for the deliberations of the Board and its Committees. DHN also has experience mentoring and coaching young talent and women.

- (iv) The length of time that DHN has remained in her role has not interfered with her ability to exercise independent judgement as an Independent Director and she has continued to contribute to the performance and positive dynamics of the Board Committees and Board.
- (v) DHN together with the other Independent Directors, each function as a check and balance to the Board and in the exercise of objectivity as Directors.
- (vi) DHN has devoted sufficient time and attention to her professional obligations to Maxis required for informed and balanced decision making.

#### **Note:**

DHN served as Interim Chairman from 1 July 2024 until 28 February 2025 and resumed her role as Independent Non-Executive Director following the appointment of Datuk Johan bin Idris as Chairman on 1 March 2025.

These meetings were attended by relevant Management, internal and external auditors.

The ARC also passed three (3) Circular Resolutions between meetings for financial and transaction approvals, as per Clause 6.3 of the TOR. The ARC Chairman promptly reported meeting outcomes, orally and in writing to the Board.

The ARC undertook the following major activities during the year:

#### **Risk Management, Internal Control and Compliance**

- Reviewed quarterly Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) reports, covering bribery and corruption risk assessments, overall risk profile, key risk updates, mitigating actions, risk appetite, and methodology to ensure key risks are identified and tracked.
- Evaluated internal and external auditor reports and discussed with Senior Management to assess the effectiveness of internal controls, including IT and network controls, financial processes, and compliance procedures.
- Reviewed cybersecurity updates from Management and discussed action plans to mitigate cyber-attack and online fraud risks.
- Discussed defalcation cases and monitored Management's recommendations for remedial actions, including Consequence Management and corrective measures.

In 2024, a third-party specialist based outside Malaysia was appointed to manage the Group's whistleblowing reporting portal, enhancing confidentiality and anonymity of the whistleblowing channel.

• Assessed updates on compliance with Maxis Anti-Bribery Management System (MABC) policies from the Head of Integrity and Governance Unit to strengthen the anti-bribery framework, in line with Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 (Amendment 2018).

#### **Financial Reporting**

- Reviewed the Group's quarterly financial results for 2024 and annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. This included:
	- Examining significant audit and accounting matters highlighted such as provisions, critical accounting judgements, and the impact of new accounting standards.
	- Deliberating with Management to ensure compliance with ARC's TOR, the MMLR, the CA 2016, Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) and other legal and regulatory requirements; whichever applicable.
	- Assessing all related party transactions, including the recurrent ones to follow MMLR and the Group's policies.

	- Monitored progress of 2024 planned risk-based audit activities: IAD conducted 35 manual engagement and developed 74 continuous automated audits in 2024, covering governance, risk management & internal control processes (51%) and fraud and bribery (49%).
	- Reviewed and discussed significant audit findings, recommendations, and monitoring Management's corrective actions.
	- Evaluated monthly automated audit reports via Key Control Checks (KCC) which transitioned to self-assessments by business units for enhanced accountability.

#### **Changes in 2024**

- Technology and automation remained central to the function. However, responsibility for continuous control monitoring was transitioned to Management, with internal controls enhancement and remediation achieved through self-assessment and self-monitoring. This shift enabled the internal audit function to concentrate on areas requiring heightened scrutiny.
- A stronger emphasis was placed on high-risk expense, revenue and high waste areas through intensified forensic reviews, targeting transactions and practices that posed potential risks related to bribery and corruption prevention, thereby strengthening the overall governance and integrity of the Group.
- Standard risk-based reviews continued in line with the approved audit plan, incorporating advanced analytics usage alongside manual methods, particularly in forensic reviews that would efficiently uncover fraud risks.

- Forensic reviews in high-risk areas were further intensified to identify and prevent avoidable losses. This approach was supported by close collaboration with compliance teams on anti-bribery initiatives and regular briefings that enhanced stakeholder engagement.
- These approaches will continue in 2025.

#### **External Audit**

- Reviewed the external auditor's report on the progress of the audit including audit and accounting matters, internal control recommendations and status of closure.

• Deliberated on the results of internal audit's review on LTIP grants for the financial year, to ensure the allocation for employees was as per approved criteria and disclosed pursuant to LTIP's By-Laws and MMLR.

#### **PROCEEDINGS OF THE ARC MEETINGS**

Deliberations during the ARC meetings were recorded in the minutes and tabled for confirmation at the subsequent ARC meeting. After each meeting, the ARC Chairman reported the proceedings to the Board. During the year 2024, the ARC Chairman communicated key issues, including those raised by the internal or external auditors, during the respective quarterly financial presentations for discussion at Board meetings.

The ARC held separate private sessions with the internal and external auditors without the presence of Management, as and when required. Both the internal and external auditors have unfettered access to members of the ARC, including the Chairman, any time during the year.

In addition, the ARC Chairman held many meetings with the Management, the ERM function, the internal auditors, the external auditors and the IGU function throughout the year.

Given the complexity of the business and the ARC's responsibilities, the ARC cannot discharge its role through formal meetings alone. In this regard, the ARC members actively sought information and engaged in discussions with Management either in meetings or by correspondences.

The ARC also provided guidance for Consequence Management in respect of unsatisfactory audit and forensics outcomes during the year. Given the nature of some of the issues, the ARC Chairman and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee Chairman regularly consult each other on addressing such matters.

#### **INTERNAL ASSURANCE DIVISION**

The Group has an in-house independent internal audit function (internally referred to as the IAD), which reports directly to the ARC. IAD's primary responsibility is to provide independent and objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management, internal control and governance processes.

IAD has a headcount of 21, further supported by two (2) rotational employees from the Assurance Leadership Development Program (ALDP), each assigned for a one (1) year term.

Shafik Azlee Mashar led the division until July 2024. Serving as the Group's Head of IAD for ten (10) years since 2014, he steered significant transformational changes and enhancements within the function. The ARC and Management expressed their gratitude for his valuable contributions during his tenure and wished him every success in his future endeavours. As part of the succession plan, Faizul Abdullah assumed the role of Head of IAD starting July 2024.

Faizul has 26 years of diverse experience across engineering and internal auditing, in various international and local industries. Faizul holds a Bachelor of Engineering from Imperial College London, an MBA from Sheffield University (UK), and a Master of Science in IT from UiTM. He is also a Certified Internal Auditor (CIA), Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), and Certified ScrumMaster (CSM).

The Head of IAD reports directly to the ARC Chairman and is responsible for enhancing the quality assurance and improvement programme of the internal audit function, which is monitored through internal and external assessments.

The total costs incurred for the internal audit function for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 amounted to RM5.8 million (2023: RM7.7 million). Reduction in costs during the year was mainly attributed to resource costs.

IAD fully abides by the Internal Assurance Charter, reviewed and approved by ARC annually, and conform to the IIA's International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.

Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps:

- (a) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for impairment and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made for impairment; and
- (b) to ensure that any current assets, other than debts, which were unlikely to realise in the ordinary course of business, their values as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company, had been written down to an amount which they might be expected so to realise.

- (a) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for impairment in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or

Details of the principal activities of the subsidiaries are shown in Note 18(a) to the financial statements.

There have been no significant changes in the nature of the principal activities of the Group and of the Company during the financial year.

The Directors regard BGSM Equity Holdings Sdn. Bhd. as the immediate holding company, BGSM Management Sdn. Bhd. as the penultimate holding company and Binariang GSM Sdn. Bhd. ("BGSM") as the ultimate holding company. All these companies are incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia.

The address of the principal place of business of the Company is as follows:

Level 5 - 9, 11, 15 - 25 Menara Maxis Kuala Lumpur City Centre Off Jalan Ampang 50088 Kuala Lumpur

#### **2 BASIS OF PREPARATION**

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the summary of material accounting policies in Note 3 to the financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported financial year. It also requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's and the Company's accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgements are based on the Directors' best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.

#### **2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)**

**(a) Amendments to published standards and interpretations that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company**

The Group and the Company have applied the following amendments to published standards for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2024:

- Amendments to MFRS 16 "Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback"
- Amendments to MFRS 107 and MFRS 7 "Supplier Finance Arrangements"
- Amendments to MFRS 101 "Non-current Liabilities with Covenants"

The adoption of the above amendments to published standards did not have any significant effect on the consolidated and separate financial statements of the Group and of the Company respectively upon their initial application.

#### **(b) Published standards and amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective**

The amendments below to published standards are effective for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2025:

- Amendments to MFRS 9 and MFRS 7 "Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments"
- MFRS 18 "Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements"
- Annual Improvements to MFRS Accounting Standards for enhanced consistency

The Group and Company are in the process of assessing the impact of the above published standards and amendments to published standards to the financial statements of the Group and Company in the initial year of application.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the financial statements.

#### **(a) Basis of consolidation**

#### **(i) Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(a) Basis of consolidation (continued)**

#### **(i) Subsidiaries (continued)**

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations when the acquired sets of activities and assets meet the definition of business. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and fair value of any preexisting equity interest in the subsidiary. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-byacquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date and any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. See accounting policy Note 3(c)(iii) on goodwill.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position respectively.

All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the parent and the non-controlling interests, even if the attribution of losses to the non-controlling interests results in a debit balance in the shareholders' equity. Profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests for prior years is not restated.

#### **(ii) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control**

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the Group.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(b) Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure (including borrowing and staff costs) that is directly attributable to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of certain property, plant and equipment items include the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the sites on which these items are located. These costs are due to obligations incurred either when the items were installed or as a consequence of having used these items during a particular period.

Certain telecommunications assets are stated at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired. Included in telecommunications equipment are purchased software costs which are integral to such equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred.

Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.

All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method to write-off the cost of each category of assets to its residual value over its estimated useful life, summarised as follows:

| Buildings                                | 44 - 50 years |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Telecommunications equipment             | 2 - 25 years  |
| Motor vehicles                           | 5 years       |
| Office furniture, fittings and equipment | 3 - 7 years   |

Capital work-in-progress and capital inventories comprise mainly telecommunications equipment, information technology equipment and renovations. They are reclassified to the respective categories of property, plant and equipment and depreciated when they are ready for their intended use.

Residual values and useful lives are reassessed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date to ensure the amount and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the asset is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in the statement of profit or loss.

Leased assets (including leasehold land) are presented as "right-of-use assets" in a separate line item in the statement of financial position.

#### **(c) Intangible assets**

The Group acquires intangible assets either as part of a business combination or through separate acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition and recognised separately from goodwill. On initial acquisition, management judgement is applied to determine the appropriate allocation of purchase consideration to the assets being acquired, including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(c) Intangible assets (continued)**

#### **(i) Spectrum rights**

The Group's spectrum rights consist of rights to spectrum bands previously acquired as part of a business combination and other spectrum rights.

For other spectrum rights, the intangible asset that is initially recognised at the date of acquisition includes an estimate for the future anticipated variable costs. Subsequent changes on such estimates will be recognised against the cost of the asset.

Spectrum rights are considered to have a finite life and thus are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit and assessed at each reporting date for any indication of impairment. Upon the expiry of the Spectrum Assignment ("SA") periods, costs to renew spectrum rights that are previously acquired as part of a business combination are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the SA periods.

The estimated useful lives of the spectrum rights of the Group are as follows:

| Spectrum rights acquired as part of a business combination | According to SA period       |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Other spectrum rights                                      | According to contract period |

The useful lives are reassessed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

#### **(ii) Other indefinite life intangible assets - telecommunications licences**

Telecommunications licences comprise the rights that exist with the embedded approvals of the Government to allow Maxis to operate as one of the few mobile operators in Malaysia together with all the ancillary Network Facilities Provider ("NFP"), Network Service Provider ("NSP") and Applications Service Provider ("ASP") licences. The telecommunications licences were acquired as part of a business combination and are issued for a fixed period.

Telecommunications licences are considered to have an indefinite useful life if they can be renewed indefinitely without significant costs in comparison to the expected future economic benefits that the rights can generate for the Group. Therefore, the telecommunications licences are not amortised but tested for impairment on an annual basis, and where an indication of impairment exists.

See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

The indefinite useful life assumption applied to this acquired intangible assets is reassessed at each reporting date. When the expectation differs from previous estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.

### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(c) Intangible assets (continued)**

#### **(iii) Goodwill**

Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregation of the consideration transferred for purchase of subsidiaries or businesses, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units ("CGUs") for the purpose of impairment testing. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets. Each CGU or a group of CGUs represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

#### **(iv) Software**

Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.

Expenditure which enhances or extends the performance of computer software programmes beyond their original specifications is recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense when incurred.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Software recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated useful economic lives of 2.5 – 8 years.

No amortisation is calculated on software development until the underlying software is completed and is ready for its intended use.

#### **(v) Customer relationships**

Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. It has a finite useful life that ranges between 1 to 8 years and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefits and assessed at each reporting date whether any indication of impairment exists. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(d) Investments in subsidiaries**

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses plus the fair value of share grants over the Company's equity instruments for employees (including full-time executive directors) of the subsidiaries during the vesting period, deemed as capital contribution. See accounting policy Note 3(s)(iii) on share-based compensation benefits. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

#### **(e) Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of another enterprise.

A financial asset is any asset that is cash, a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another enterprise, a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially favourable, or an equity instrument of another enterprise.

A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another enterprise, or to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially unfavourable.

#### **Financial assets**

#### **(i) Classification**

The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income ("OCI") or through profit or loss); and
- those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group and the Company have made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI").

The Group and the Company reclassify debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

#### **(ii) Recognition and derecognition**

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group and the Company commit to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(e) Financial instruments (continued)**

#### **Financial assets (continued)**

#### **(iii) Measurement**

At initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss ("FVPL"), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

#### Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's and the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the Company classify their debt instruments:

• Amortised cost:

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other operating expenses together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

• FVOCI:

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other operating expenses. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other operating expenses and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

• FVPL:

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other operating expenses in the period in which it arises.

#### Equity instruments

The Group and the Company subsequently measure all equity instruments at fair value. Where the Group's and the Company's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised within other operating expenses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(e) Financial instruments (continued)**

#### **Financial assets (continued)**

#### **(iv) Subsequent measurement - impairment**

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss ("ECL") associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and at FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The Group has five types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:

- Trade receivables
- Finance lease receivables
- Contract assets
- Other receivables and deposits
- Amounts due from related parties

The Company has two types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:

- Other receivables and deposits
- Loans due from a subsidiary

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9 "Financial Instruments", the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between present value of cash flows according to contract and present value of cash flows the Group expects to receive, over the remaining life of the financial instrument.

The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
- (a) General 3-stage approach for other receivables, deposits, and loans to subsidiaries

At each reporting date, the Group measures ECL through loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL is required.

(b) Simplified approach for trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties.

The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure ECL which uses a lifetime ECL for all the above.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(e) Financial instruments (continued)**

#### **Financial assets (continued)**

#### **(iv) Subsequent measurement - impairment (continued)**

#### Significant increase in credit risk

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportable forward-looking information.

The following indicators are incorporated:

- internal credit rating; and
- actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor's ability to meet its obligations.

Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is incorporated as part of the internal rating model.

A significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making contractual payment.

#### Definition of default and credit-impaired financial assets

The Group defines a financial instrument as default, when counterparty fails to make contractual payment more than 90 days after they fall due or the debtor is insolvent or has significant financial difficulties.

Financial instruments that are credit-impaired are assessed on individual basis.

For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties, balances that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis based on similar risk characteristics.

#### Groupings of instruments for ECL measured on collective basis

(a) Collective assessment

To measure ECL, trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics of customer's behaviour and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled amounts and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

(b) Individual assessment

Trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets, other receivables and deposits, related parties' owings and loans due from a subsidiary that are in default or credit-impaired are assessed individually.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(e) Financial instruments (continued)**

#### **Financial assets (continued)**

#### **(iv) Subsequent measurement - impairment (continued)**

#### Write-off

(a) Trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties

The above is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group.

Impairment losses on the above are presented within 'Impairment of receivables and deposits, net' in the statements of profit or loss. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item in the statements of profit or loss.

(b) Other receivables and deposits and loans due from a subsidiary

The Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The assessment of no reasonable expectation of recovery is based on unavailability of debtor's sources of income or assets to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount. The Group may write-off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity. These are presented as net impairment losses within 'Impairment of receivables and deposits, net' in the statements of profit or loss. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

#### **Financial liabilities**

#### **(i) Classification and measurement**

The Group and the Company classify their financial liabilities in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, other financial liabilities and financial guarantee contracts. Management determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition.

The Group and the Company do not hold any financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss (except for derivative financial instruments and deferred contingent consideration arising from business combinations) and financial guarantee contracts. See accounting policy Note 3(g) on derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.

Other financial liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial liability and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Changes in the carrying value of these liabilities are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

The Group's and the Company's other financial liabilities comprise payables (including inter-companies and related parties' balances) and borrowings in the statement of financial position. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities; except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, in which case they are classified as non-current liabilities.

![](_page_115_Picture_0.jpeg)

### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(e) Financial instruments (continued)**

#### **Financial liabilities (continued)**

#### **(ii) Recognition and derecognition**

Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group and the Company become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is either discharged, cancelled, expired or has been restructured with substantially different terms.

#### **Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

### **(f) Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that have a finite economic useful life are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets ("CGUs"). Nonfinancial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

Any impairment loss is charged to the statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. In respect of other assets, any subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

#### **(g) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date.

A derivative financial instrument is carried as an asset when the fair value is positive and as a liability when the fair value is negative.

The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as "held for trading" and accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(g) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (continued)**

#### **Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either:**

- Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);
- Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
- Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).

The Group documents at the inception of the hedge relationship, the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 23. Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders' equity are shown in Note 33(c). The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.

#### **Cash flow hedge**

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within 'finance costs'.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the accounting of any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging included in equity depends on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. For cash flow hedge which resulted in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the cumulative amount in equity shall be included in the initial cost of the asset. For other cash flow hedges, the cumulative amount in equity is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. When hedged future cash flows or forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

The Group and the Company do not have any fair value hedges and net investment hedges.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(h) Fair value estimates**

The fair value of the financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments is estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes.

In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Group makes certain assumptions and applies the estimated discounted value of future cash flows to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows at the current interest rate available to the respective companies.

The face values for financial assets and financial liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to be approximately equal to their fair values.

For derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value, the fair values are determined using a valuation technique which utilises data from recognised financial information sources. Assumptions are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date. The fair values of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flow using an appropriate market-based yield curve. The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are determined using the forward exchange rates as at each reporting date.

#### **(i) Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the actual cost of materials and incidentals in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, and is determined on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

#### **(j) Trade and other receivables**

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, where they are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs.

After recognition, trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less loss allowance. See Note 3(e)(iv) for the impairment policy on receivables.

#### **(k) Leases**

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the rights to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

#### **Accounting as lessee**

Leases are recognised as right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group (i.e. the commencement date).

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(k) Leases (continued)**

#### **Accounting as lessee (continued)**

#### **(i) Lease term**

In determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not to be terminated).

In determining the enforceable period of the lease, the Group considers the following:

- the broader economics of the contract, and not only contractual termination payments. If either party has an economic incentive not to terminate the lease such that it would incur a penalty on termination that is more than insignificant, the contract is deemed enforceable beyond the date on which the contract can be terminated; and
- whether each of the parties has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty. A lease is no longer enforceable only when both parties have such a right. Consequently, if only one party has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty, the contract is deemed enforceable beyond the date on which the contract can be terminated by that party.

The Group reassesses the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances that is within the control of the Group and affects whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in the determination of lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in the determination of lease term. A revision in lease term results in remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

#### **(ii) ROU assets**

ROU assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received;
- any initial direct costs; and
- decommissioning and restoration costs.

ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. In addition, the ROU assets are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

The ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis, as follows:

| Land and network infrastructure      | 2 - 97 years |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| Offices and customer service centers | 2 - 15 years |

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(k) Leases (continued)**

#### **Accounting as lessee (continued)**

#### **(iii) Lease liabilities**

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include the following:

- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;
- the exercise price of extension options if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

The Group presents the lease liabilities within borrowings in the statement of financial position. Interest expense on the lease liability is presented within the finance cost in the statement of profit or loss.

Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. This is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the ROU in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

#### **(iv) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets**

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment, land and buildings, and network cell sites and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the statement of profit or loss.

#### **Accounting as a lessor**

As a lessor, the Group determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

#### **(i) Finance leases**

The Group classifies a lease as a finance lease if the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.

The Group derecognises the underlying asset and recognises a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in a finance lease. Net investment in a finance lease is measured at an amount equal to the sum of the present value of lease payments from the lessee and the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying asset. Initial direct costs are also included in the initial measurement of the net investment.

Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return. The Group revises the lease income allocation if there is a reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual value.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(k) Leases (continued)**

#### **Accounting as a lessor (continued)**

#### **(ii) Operating leases**

The Group classifies a lease as an operating lease if the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.

The Group recognises lease payments received under an operating lease as lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature.

#### **(iii) Separating lease and non-lease components**

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on the stand-alone selling prices in accordance with the principles in MFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".

#### **(l) Loans to subsidiaries**

Loans to subsidiaries are recognised initially at fair value. If there are any difference between cash disbursed and fair value on initial recognition, the difference would be accounted as additional investment in the subsidiary as it reflects the substance of the transaction.

Loans to subsidiaries are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less loss allowance. See Note 3(e)(iv) for the impairment policy on receivables.

#### **(m) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other shortterm, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of deposits with maturity more than three months.

#### **(n) Share capital**

#### **(i) Classification**

Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares with discretionary dividends are classified as equity. Other shares are classified as equity and/or liability according to the economic substance of the particular instrument. Distributions to holders of a financial instrument classified as an equity instrument are charged directly to equity.

#### **(ii) Share issue costs**

External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted, net of tax, against proceeds and shown in equity.

![](_page_121_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(o) Payables**

Payables, including accruals, represent liabilities for goods received and services rendered to the Group and the Company prior to the end of the financial year and which remain unpaid. Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Payables are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, which include transfer taxes and duties. Payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

#### **(p) Borrowings**

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss when incurred.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Interest expense, losses and gains relating to a financial instrument, or a component part, classified as a liability is reported within finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

Borrowings are derecognised from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is extinguished, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss within finance costs.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

#### **(i) Borrowings in a designated hedging relationship**

Borrowings subject to cash flow hedges are recognised initially at fair value based on the applicable interest rate plus any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of borrowing. These borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised costs. Any difference between the final amount paid to discharge the borrowing and the initial proceeds is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.

Interest expense on the borrowings are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, along with the associated gains or losses on the hedging instrument, which have been reclassified from the cash flow hedging reserve to the statement of profit or loss.

#### **(ii) Borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship**

Borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of borrowing. These borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised costs. Any difference between the final amount paid to discharge the borrowing and the initial proceeds is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(q) Provisions for liabilities and charges**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. When it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

#### **(i) Site rectification and decommissioning works**

Provision for site rectification works is based on management's best estimate and the past trend of costs for rectification works to be carried out to fulfil new regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed after network cell sites were built.

Provision for decommissioning works is the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the structures on identified sites and restoring these sites. This obligation is incurred either when the items are installed or as a consequence of having used the items during a particular period.

The estimated amount is determined after taking into consideration the time value of money, risk specific to the provision and the current conditions of the sites. The initial estimated amount is capitalised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment.

#### **(ii) Staff incentive scheme**

Provision for staff incentive scheme is based on management's best estimate of the total employee benefits payable as at reporting date based on the service and/or performance conditions of individual employees and/or financial performance of the Group.

#### **(r) Income taxes**

The tax expenses for the period comprise current and deferred tax. The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. Tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax expenses are determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Group operates and include all taxes based upon the taxable profits, and real property gains taxes payable on disposal of properties.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for tax purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, investment tax allowance or unused tax losses can be utilised.

![](_page_123_Picture_0.jpeg)

### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(r) Income taxes (continued)**

Deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.

Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets shall reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the entity expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority or either the taxable entity or different taxable entities when there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

#### **(s) Employee benefits**

#### **(i) Short-term employee benefits**

Salaries, paid annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

#### **(ii) Defined contribution plans**

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis, and the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

The Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations. The Group recognises a provision when an employee has provided services in exchange for employee benefits to be paid in the future. When contributions to a defined contribution plan are not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service, they shall be discounted to present value.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(s) Employee benefits (continued)**

#### **(iii) Share-based compensation benefits**

The Group and the Company operate equity-settled, share-based compensation plans for eligible employees (including full-time executive directors) of the Group and of the Company, pursuant to the Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") and incentive arrangement.

Where the Group and the Company pay for services of employees using the share grants, the fair value of the share grants which is determined using the observable market price of the shares at the grant date is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss over the vesting periods, with a corresponding increase in equity.

When the shares of the Company are acquired from the open market at market price using cash incentive payable to employees under the incentive arrangement, the transactions are recorded in share-based payments reserve and are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss over the vesting periods.

The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and the number of shares that are expected to vest by the vesting date. At each reporting date, the Group and the Company revise this estimated number of shares and any revision of this estimate is included in the statement of profit or loss and with the corresponding adjustment in equity.

Non-market vesting conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. Non-market vesting and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest.

When share grants are forfeited due to failure by the employee to satisfy the service and/or performance conditions, any expenses previously recognised in relation to such share grants are reversed effective on the date of the forfeiture.

If the share grants expire or lapse, the corresponding share-based payments reserve attributable to the share grants are transferred to retained earnings.

In the separate financial statements of the Company, the fair value of the share grants offered to employees of the subsidiary in exchange for the services of employees to the subsidiary are treated as a capital contribution and thus recognised as investment in subsidiary, with a corresponding credit to equity.

#### **(iv) Separation benefits**

Separation benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

The Group recognises separation benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of MFRS 137 and involves the payment of separation benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the separation benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(t) Income recognition**

#### **(i) Revenue from contract with customers**

#### Telecommunications revenue

Revenue from prepaid services is recognised when services are rendered. Consideration from the sale of prepaid sim cards and reload vouchers to customers where services have not been rendered at the reporting date is deferred as contract liability until actual usage or when the cards, vouchers or reloaded amounts are expired or forfeited.

Postpaid services are provided in postpaid packages which consist of a series of promised services including voice, data, text, digital and other converged telecommunications services. As the services are separately identifiable and the customers can benefit from each of the services on its own, each service is accounted for as a separate performance obligation.

For postpaid usage-based plans, revenue is recognised when the customers use the services and is measured at the consideration specified in the contract.

Fixed fee postpaid service plans may include services which provide customers with limited and unlimited usage for the respective services within the plan. For services with unlimited usage, revenue is recognised proportionately over the fixed fee billing period based on the consideration allocated for the service. For services with limited usage, revenue is recognised when the customer utilises their entitled usage and is measured based on the consideration allocated for the service. Services with limited usage can be utilised up to the end of the fixed fee period. At the end of the fixed fee period, the remaining consideration allocated for the service which has not been utilised is recognised as revenue in full.

The consideration specified in the contract is adjusted for expected discounts and rebates for contracts which offer discounted rates when certain volume commitments are met, to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method. As the amount billed to customer is higher than the transaction price, a contract liability is recognised.

Postpaid packages are either sold separately or bundled together with the sale of a device to a customer. Devices can also be obtained separately from other device retailers and can be used together with the postpaid packages provided by the Group. As postpaid packages and devices are capable of being distinct and separately identifiable, there are two performance obligations within a bundled transaction. Accordingly, the Group allocates the transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling prices ("RSSP") of the postpaid packages and device.

Stand-alone selling prices are based on observable sales prices; however, where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, estimates will be made maximising the use of observable inputs.

#### Sale of device

Revenue from sale of device is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, usually on delivery and acceptance of the device.

Payment for the transaction price of the device is typically collected at the point the customer signs up for the bundled contract, except for bundled packages that have a payment structure allowing customers to pay for the device over a period of up to 36 months. For these arrangements, the Group discounts the transaction price using the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the Group and its customers at contract inception, to take into consideration the significant financing component. The financing component is recognised as interest revenue over the contract period and presented as part of the revenue of the Group.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(t) Income recognition (continued)**

#### **(i) Revenue from contract with customers (continued)**

#### Sale of device (continued)

A contract asset is recognised when the Group delivers the devices before the payment is due. If the payment happens before the delivery of the device then a contract liability is recognised. Contract assets and contract liabilities are presented within receivables and payables respectively in the statement of financial position.

Devices and equipment that are transferred as part of a fixed line telecommunications services bundled package which can only be used together with the services provided by the Group, are considered as a single performance obligation in telecommunications services revenue.

The contract for sale of devices does not give the customers a right of return nor responsibilities within the ambit of device manufacturer's warranty.

When another party is involved in providing devices to a customer, the Group is a principal in such arrangements when it controls the devices before they are transferred to the customers. As the principal, the Group recognises revenue on the gross consideration allocated to the devices with the corresponding direct costs of satisfying the contract.

#### Customer loyalty programme

The Group operates a loyalty programme which may provide the customers a material right to acquire future products and services from the Group or selected partner vendors of the Group for free or at a discount.

Where there is a material right to the customer, a portion of the consideration specified in the contract is allocated to the material right on a RSSP basis. The consideration allocated is recognised as a contract liability. Revenue is only recognised when the material rights such as free goods or discounts are redeemed or expired.

#### **(ii) Interest revenue**

Interest revenue on receivables from contracts with customers with significant financing components is recognised over the customer's contract period using an effective interest rate reflecting the customers' credit risk.

#### **(iii) Contract assets**

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are presented within "Receivables, deposits and prepayments" of the statement of financial position.

#### **(iv) Contract liabilities**

Contract liability is the unsatisfied obligation by the Group to transfer goods or services to customer for which the Group has received the consideration in advance or has billed the customer, whichever is earlier. Contract liabilities are presented within "Payables and accruals" of the statement of financial position.

Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.

### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(t) Income recognition (continued)**

#### **(v) Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the Group's and the Company's right to receive payment is established.

#### **(vi) Interest income**

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group and the Company.

#### **(u) Incremental costs incurred to acquire a contract**

The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, sales commissions are recognised as contract cost assets as these are incremental costs that would not have been incurred by the Group if the respective contracts had not been obtained. The Group expects to recover these costs in the future through telecommunications services revenue earned from the customer. These are amortised consistently over the term of the specific contract to which the cost relates to.

Where the costs incurred to acquire a contract are in respect of contracts with amortisation period of less than one year, these are recognised as an expense when incurred in line with the practical expedient elected by the Group.

Amortisation of contract acquisition costs is presented within traffic, device, commissions and other direct costs within the statement of profit or loss.

An impairment loss is recognised to profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost asset recognised exceeds the remaining amount of considerations that the Group expects to receive for the specific contract that the cost relate to less additional costs required to complete the specific contract.

#### **(v) Deferred income – Government grant**

As a Universal Service Provider, the Group is entitled to claim certain qualified expenses from the relevant authorities in relation to Universal Service Provider projects. The claim qualifies as a government grant and is recognised at its fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all the attached conditions.

Government grants relating to costs are recognised as income in the statement of profit or loss to match them with the expenses they are intended to compensate in the period they are incurred.

Government grants relating to the purchase of assets are included in non-current liabilities in the statement of financial position as deferred income and are credited to the statement of profit or loss as income on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the corresponding assets.

#### **(w) Contingent liabilities**

The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare circumstance where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably.

#### **3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

#### **(x) Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers comprising the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for allocating resources, assessing performance of the operating segments and making strategic decisions.

#### **(y) Associates**

Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. The Group's interests in associates are accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the associates in profit or loss, and the Group's share of movements in other comprehensive income ("OCI") of the associates in OCI.

Dividends received or receivable from an associate are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interests in the entity, including any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the investee, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interests in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The Group ceases to equity account its investments upon loss of significant influence.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that an equity-accounted investment is impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount.

See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

### **4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

### **Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are anticipated to have a material impact on the Group's and the Company's results and financial position are tested for sensitivity to changes in the underlying parameters. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.

#### **Critical accounting estimates and judgements - Group**

#### **(a) Impairment assessment of intangible assets - goodwill**

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequent if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. When performing an impairment testing, the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations require management's estimates and are sensitive to changes in compounded revenue and EBITDA (i.e. profit before finance income, finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation and allowance for write down of identified network costs) annual growth rates in the projection period, post-tax discount rate and terminal growth rate. See Note 16 to the financial statements for the key assumptions on the impairment assessment of goodwill.

#### **(b) Estimated useful lives and impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets software**

The Group reviews annually the estimated useful lives and assesses for indicators of impairment of property, plant and equipment and software within the intangible assets based on factors such as business plans and strategies, historical sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, regulatory landscape, expected level of usage, future technological developments and other available information. It is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these estimates brought about by changes in the factors mentioned. Any impairment or reduction in the estimated useful lives would increase charges to the statement of profit or loss and decrease their carrying value. See Note 15 to the financial statements for the impact of the changes in the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment.

### **(c) Provisions for liabilities and charges**

The Group recognises provisions for liabilities and charges when it has a present legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made. The recording of provision requires the application of judgements about the ultimate resolution of these obligations. As a result, provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the Group's current best estimate. See Note 28 to the financial statements for the impact on changes in estimates.

#### **4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

#### **Critical accounting estimates and judgements - Group (continued)**

#### **(d) Revenue recognition for contracts with customers**

#### Identification of performance obligation

Certain contracts with customers are bundled packages that may include sale of products and telecommunications services that comprise voice, data and other converged telecommunications and solutions services. The Group accounts for individual products and services separately as separate performance obligations if they are distinct promised goods and services, i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it separately. The Group exercises judgements to identify if products and services within the bundled package are distinct as a separate promised products and services. This determination will affect the allocation of consideration specified in the contract and the revenue recognised for each performance obligation.

#### Principal versus agent

The Group is a principal for sale of devices as the Group controls the device before it is transferred to the customer. In making such an assessment, the Group takes into consideration both the legal form of the contract with its customer and supplier. Revenue from sale of device is recognised on a gross basis and payment to the supplier for device cost is recorded as a direct cost.

#### Determining stand-alone selling price ("SSP")

The Group has assessed that there are two performance obligations for bundled contracts where the Group needs to allocate the transaction price between the postpaid service and device based on their relative SSP.

SSP for postpaid packages and devices are based on observable sales prices; however, where certain SSP are not directly observable, estimates will be made maximising the use of observable inputs.

The estimation of SSP is a significant estimate as it will directly determine the amount of revenue to be recognised up front (sale of device) and amount of revenue to be recognised over time (telecommunications revenue). For example, a lower SSP for device will result in a lower amount of revenue recognised upfront and higher amount of revenue recognised over the contract period.

#### **(e) Determining the lease term where the Group acts as a lessee**

In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period of a lease, the Group applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable. However, for leases of certain telecommunications network sites, the contract contains an exit clause that is exercisable by both the lessee and lessor with a short notification period. For such contracts, the Group considers whether the lessee and lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without the permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty, in determining the lease term. In determining a penalty, the Group assesses monetary and non-monetary considerations which include amongst others, network cell site relocation effort.

The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.

The determination of the lease term is a significant judgement as it will directly affect the recognition of a lease as a short term lease or a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability. For example, a short term lease is recognised as an expense in the profit or loss throughout the lease term while a lease recognised as a right-of-use asset is capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term with a corresponding lease liability measured at the present value of the lease payments.

### **4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

#### **Critical accounting estimates and judgements - Group (continued)**

#### **(f) Income taxes**

Significant estimation is involved in determining the Group's provision for income taxes as there are certain transactions and computations for which the final tax determination is uncertain at the reporting date. The Group applies consistent tax treatment on such transactions and computations when determining the Group's provision for income taxes for all years of assessment.

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

#### **(g) Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets**

The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected loss rates, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. These historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables such as unemployment rate, interest rate and economic outlook. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The Group estimates the relationship between historical loss rates and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors and ECL which may not be representative of a customer's actual default in the future.

### **Critical accounting estimates and judgements - Company**

#### **(a) Investments in subsidiaries**

The Company will assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the investment in subsidiaries may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company will perform an impairment assessment on the carrying amount of its investment against its recoverable amount.

The key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount require management's estimates and are sensitive to changes in compounded revenue and EBITDA annual growth rates in the projection period, post-tax discount rate and terminal growth rate. See Note 18 to the financial statements for the key assumptions on the impairment assessment of the investments in subsidiaries.

### **5 SEGMENT REPORTING**

Segment reporting is not presented as the Group is primarily engaged in providing converged telecommunications services and solutions in Malaysia, whereby the measurement of profit or loss including EBIT (i.e. profit before finance income, finance costs and tax expenses) that is used by the chief operating decision-makers is on a Group basis.

The Group's operations are mainly in Malaysia. In determining the geographical segments of the Group, revenues are based on the country in which the customer or international operator is located. Non-current assets by geographical segments are not disclosed as all operations of the Group are based in Malaysia.

#### Note (i)

In the previous financial year, Maxis Broadband Sdn. Bhd. ("MBSB"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company paid additional tax of RM73 million as full and final settlement pursuant to the agreed global settlement terms with Inland Revenue Board ("IRB") for the following notices of additional assessments:

- (i) Notice of additional assessment issued in November 2019 disallowed MBSB from its entitlement to incremental chargeable income exemption ("ICI Notice") for Year of Assessment 2017; and
- (ii) Notices of additional assessment issued in November 2020, March 2021, February 2022 and April 2023, disallowed MBSB's deduction of interest expenses incurred for the Years of Assessment 2016 and 2017, 2018 and 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively.

A settlement agreement was subsequently signed in accordance with the Income Tax Act 1967 on 14 February 2024.

#### **(b) Diluted earnings per share**

For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issuance of the Company is adjusted to assume full conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares to be issued by the Company.

Share grants are treated as contingently issuable shares because their issuance is contingent upon satisfying specified vesting conditions comprising, amongst others, performance targets and/or conditions, as disclosed in Note 32(a) to the financial statements, in addition to the passage of time. They are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share where the vesting conditions would not have been satisfied as at the end of the financial year.

\* Less than RM1 million.

During the financial year, the Group revised the useful lives of certain telecommunications equipment ranging from 7 to 10 years to useful lives ranging from 5 to 12 years (2023: 9 to 7 years). The revision was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and as a result, the depreciation charge for the financial year had increased by RM5 million (2023: RM121 million).

The Group accelerated the depreciation of certain telecommunications equipment, as the Group intends to replace the equipment due to future network upgrades. The impact of the accelerated depreciation is RM5 million.

\* Less than RM1 million.

#### **(a) Goodwill**

Included in the carrying value of goodwill are:

- (i) RM9,530 million (2023: RM9,530 million) that arose from the Company's acquisition of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of the subsidiaries previously held by Maxis Communication Berhad ("MCB") pursuant to a restructuring exercise completed in financial year 2009 to consolidate the telecommunications operations in Malaysia under the Company ("Pre-Listing Restructuring"); and
- (ii) RM153 million (2023: RM155 million) that arose from the acquisition of other businesses. These businesses provide synergy to the Group's existing business.

#### **(b) Spectrum rights**

Spectrum rights consist of rights to spectrum bands previously acquired during the Pre-Listing Restructuring exercise in financial year 2009 and it includes the frequency band of 900MHz and 2100MHz. As disclosed in Note 22(c) to the financial statements, these spectrums were reissued to the Group in the form of Spectrum Assignment ("SA") with some upfront price component fees for which the Group has paid in full ("SA fee paid").

In the current financial year, the Group recognised impairment on goodwill of RM2 million (2023: RM2 million) as the carrying amount of goodwill relating to a subsidiary exceeds its recoverable amount.

#### **16 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)**

Impairment testing for CGU containing goodwill and telecommunications licences

For the purpose of impairment testing, the carrying amounts of goodwill and telecommunications licences are allocated to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on internally approved financial budgets covering a five-year (2023: five-year) period.

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:

- (a) compounded revenue and EBITDA annual growth rates of 2.1% and 0.1% (2023: 3.9% and 4.0%) respectively and capital expenditure for five years financial budget period which reflect management's expectations based on past experience and estimated 5G network costs, current regulatory landscape and future expectations of business performance;
- (b) post-tax discount rate of 8.0% (2023: 8.3%). In accordance with the requirements of MFRS 136 "Impairment of Assets", this translates into a pre-tax discount rate of 13.9% (2023: 12.7%). The discount rates used reflect specific risks relating to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU; and
- (c) terminal growth rate of 2.1% (2023: 2.5%) represents the growth rate applied to extrapolate pre-tax cash flow beyond the five-year (2023: five-year) financial budget period. This growth rate is based on management's assessment of future trends in the mobile telecommunications industry, the operating and regulatory landscape, new growth opportunities in fixed broadband and enterprise business, using both external and internal sources.

Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Directors have concluded that any variation of 10% (2023: 10%) in the base case assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

#### **(a) Investments in subsidiaries (continued)**

During the current financial year, the net assets of certain subsidiaries were lower than the carrying amount of the investments. Thus, the Company has carried out the following:

- i) investment in a subsidiary was tested for impairment whereby the recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations as disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements, adjusted for the financing cash flows forecast of the subsidiary. No impairment charge was recognised as the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Directors have concluded that any variation of 2.2% (2023: 7.8%) in the base case assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of the investment to exceed its recoverable amount.
- ii) investment in other subsidiaries was tested for impairment and the Company recognised impairment losses of RM5 million (2023: RM18 million) on the investment as the carrying amount of the investment exceeded the recoverable amount.

Information on the subsidiaries is as follows:

#### **(b) Advances to Digital Nasional Berhad**

On 1 December 2023, Maxis Broadband Sdn. Bhd. ("MBSB"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a conditional share subscription agreement ("SSA") with DNB and Minister of Finance, Incorporated ("MoF Inc") to subscribe for an equity stake in DNB ("Proposed Investment"). The Proposed Investment involves the subscription of 100,000 new ordinary shares in DNB and prepayment towards products and services to be delivered by DNB pursuant to the Access Agreement amounting to RM233,233,333 ("AA prepayment"). In accordance with the terms and conditions of the SSA, the SSA had been completed on 28 June 2024 and provide Maxis the eligibility to potentially own and operate the second 5G network.

Upon completion of the SSA, MBSB has entered into a shareholders' agreement with DNB, MoF Inc, YTL Power International Berhad, Infranation Sdn. Bhd. and U Mobile Sdn. Bhd. (collectively referred to as the "Investor Shareholders") ("Shareholders Agreement").

The AA Prepayment is now regarded as shareholder advances to DNB ("Shareholder Advances"), which carries the same voting rights accorded to an ordinary shareholder in DNB, i.e. each Ringgit Malaysia of Shareholder Advance is entitled to one vote. The Shareholder Advances is interest-free and is not repayable on demand.

#### **(c) Options to purchase ordinary shares and loan in DNB**

The Shareholders Agreement sets out the terms for transition to a dual 5G network model including a put option for MoF Inc. to sell its 500,000,000 ordinary shares at RM1 each ("MoF Share") and transfer its shareholder advance of RM450,000,000 ("MoF Loan") in DNB (both collectively, "MoF Put Option") to Investor Shareholders. Upon the exercise of MoF Put Option, each Investor Shareholder is required to purchase its proportion of MoF Share and take over its proportion of MoF Loan. If MoF Inc fails to exercise the MoF Put Option, each Investor Shareholder may exercise the call option granted to the investors under the Shareholders Agreement ("Investor Shareholders Call Option"). Upon the exercise of Investor Shareholders Call Option, MoF Inc is required to sell to the Investor Shareholders their proportion of the MoF Share and MoF Loan.

An equity restructuring exercise shall take place after the completion of the MoF Put Option or Investor Shareholders Call Option. The Investor Shareholders will split into one group consisting of shareholders that remain in DNB and another group that will sell its equity in DNB ("Exiting Shareholders"). The Exiting Shareholders may proceed to form an entity to provide the second 5G network. The Exiting Shareholders have put options to sell its ordinary shares owned and MoF Loan acquired to the remaining shareholders in DNB in proportion to their shareholding in DNB ("Exiting Shareholders Put Option"). If the Exiting Shareholders fail to exercise the Exiting Shareholders Put Option, the shareholders remaining in DNB have call options to require the Exiting Shareholders to sell its ordinary shares owned and MoF Loan acquired.

On 1 November 2024, Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission's (MCMC) announced that U Mobile was selected as the mobile network operator to build and operate the nation's second 5G network. Subsequently, on 31 December 2024, the Minister of Communication issued a Ministerial Direction for the implementation of the 5G dual network model.

#### **(c) Options to purchase ordinary shares and loan in DNB (continued)**

As at 31 December 2024, none of the options have been exercised by the Investor Shareholders and MoF Inc.

Based on the Shareholders Agreement, in the event that MoF Inc and U Mobile exit DNB by way of exercising the MoF and Exiting Shareholders Put Option; or failing which, if the call options are exercised, each remaining Investor Shareholder is required to pay RM237.5 million and RM79.2 million respectively to MoF Inc and U Mobile and any unpaid interest.

- (vi) The new shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the LTIP shall, upon allotment and issuance, rank equally in all respects with the then existing issued shares and the grant holders shall not be entitled to any dividends, rights, allotments, entitlements and/or any other distributions, for which the entitlement date is prior to the date of issue of the shares; and
- (vii) The share grants will only be vested to the eligible employees of the Group (including an executive director) who have duly accepted the offer of grants under the LTIP, on their respective vesting dates, provided the following vesting conditions are fully and duly satisfied:
	- eligible employees of the Group (including an executive director) must remain in employment with the Group and shall not have given notice of resignation or received a notice of termination of service as at the vesting dates or have left the Group before time of vesting except on a "Good Leaver" basis.

#### **(b) Incentive arrangement**

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the incentive arrangement which forms part of the employment contract which an eligible key management personnel had entered into with the Group, the cash incentives payable to the eligible key management personnel were used to acquire shares of the Company from the open market. During the financial year, 1,133,800 shares (2023: 963,300 shares) of the Company were acquired from the open market and are currently held by CIMB Commerce Trustee Berhad or its nominee. Subject to fulfilment of the vesting conditions and the terms of the incentive arrangement, these shares will vest on the eligible key management personnel on a deferred basis.

Movement in the number of shares under the incentive arrangement is as follows:

|                        | Group            |                  |  |

\* Less than 1 million.

The weighted average fair value of shares acquired under the incentive arrangement based on observable market price was RM3.81 (2023: RM4.17).

The value of employee services received under the incentive arrangement was RM0.3 million (2023: net reversal of share-based payment of RM3 million).

#### **33 RESERVES**

#### **(a) Merger relief**

The merger relief was created prior to the listing and quotation exercise of the Company's shares on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad in financial year 2009 ("Listing") during the Pre-Listing Restructuring exercise. Pursuant to Section 60(4)(a) of the Companies Act, 1965, the premium on the shares issued by the Company as consideration for the acquisition of the subsidiaries is not recorded as share premium. The difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued is classified as merger relief.

#### **(b) Reserve arising from reverse acquisition**

The reserve arising from reverse acquisition was created during the Pre-Listing Restructuring exercise where MMSSB was identified as the accounting acquirer in accordance to MFRS 3 "Business Combination". The difference between the issued equity of the Company and issued equity of MMSSB together with the deemed purchase consideration of subsidiaries other than MMSSB and the cash distribution to MCB, is recorded as reserve arising from reverse acquisition.

- (b) fair value of share grants less any shares issued under the LTIP; and

### **34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

The Group's and the Company's activities expose them to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. The Group's and the Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's and the Company's financial performances. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge designated risk exposures of the underlying hedge items and does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

The Group and the Company have established financial risk management policies and procedures/mandates which provide written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and use of derivative financial instruments.

### **(a) Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of the financial instruments that will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The various components of market risk that the Group and the Company are exposed to are discussed below.

### **(i) Foreign exchange risk**

The objectives of the Group's and of the Company's currency risk management policies are to allow the Group and the Company to effectively manage the foreign exchange fluctuation against its functional currency that may arise from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage foreign exchange exposures arising from all known material foreign currency denominated commitments as and when they arise and to hedge the movements in exchange rates by establishing the rate at which a foreign currency monetary item will be settled. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts entered into as hedges of foreign currency monetary items are recognised in the financial statements when the exchange differences of the hedged monetary items are recognised in the financial statements.

#### **34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

#### **(a) Market risk (continued)**

#### **(i) Foreign exchange risk (continued)**

The currency exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group and of the Company that are not denominated in the functional currency of the respective companies are set out below. There is no currency risk in respect of intragroup receivables and payables since they are all denominated in the functional currency.

The impacts on profit before tax for the financial year are mainly as a result of foreign currency gains/(losses) on translating of USD denominated receivables, deposits, bank balances and unhedged payables. For USD payables in a designated hedging relationship, as these are effectively hedged, the foreign currency movements will not have any impact on the statement of profit or loss.

#### **(ii) Interest rate risk**

The Group's interest rate risk arises from deposits with licensed banks, trade payables under supplier financing and borrowings carrying fixed and variable interest rates and for the Company, from its deposits with licensed banks and intercompany loans. The objectives of the Group's interest rate risk management policies are to allow the Group to effectively manage the interest rate fluctuation through the use of fixed and floating interest rates debt and derivative financial instruments. The Group adopts a non-speculative stance which favours predictability over interest rate fluctuations. The interest rate profiles of the Group's borrowings are also regularly reviewed against prevailing and anticipated market interest rates to determine whether refinancing or early repayment is warranted.

The impact on profit before tax for the financial year is mainly as a result of interest expenses on floating rate borrowings.

#### **(b) Credit risk**

The objectives of the Group's and of the Company's credit risk management policies are to manage their exposure to credit risk from deposits, cash and bank balances, receivables, contract assets and derivative financial instruments. They do not expect any third parties to fail to meet their obligations given the Group's and the Company's policies of selecting creditworthy counterparties at the inception of the contracts.

#### **34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

#### **(b) Credit risk (continued)**

#### Trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets

Credit risk of receivables and contract assets is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit risks are minimised and monitored via limiting the Group's dealings with creditworthy business partners and customers. Receivables and contract assets are monitored on an ongoing basis via the Group's management reporting and dunning procedures.

#### Concentration of credit risk

The Group has no significant exposure to any individual customer, geographical location or industry category. Significant credit and recovery risks associated with receivables and contract assets have been provided for in the financial statements.

#### Impairment of trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets

The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. To measure the ECL, receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are determined based on 5-year historical ageing profile and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables and contract assets. Some of the factors which the Group has identified include unemployment rate, Consumer Price Index ("CPI") and annual Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") growth and has adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in such factors.

On that basis, the loss allowance was determined as follows for trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets:

|                           |                       | 1 to 30<br>days        | 31 to 60<br>days       | 61 to 90<br>days       | 91 to 120<br>days                                                                     | > 120<br>days          |                     |

#### **34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

#### **(b) Credit risk (continued)**

#### Deposits, cash and bank balances

For deposits, cash and bank balances, the Group and the Company seek to ensure that cash assets are invested safely and profitably by assessing counterparty risks and allocating placement limits for various creditworthy financial institutions.

While deposits, cash and bank balances are also subject to the impairment requirements, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

#### Other financial assets at amortised cost

Other financial assets at amortised cost include other receivables, deposits and amounts due from related parties. The movement on Group's loss allowances for other financial assets at amortised cost is as follows:

\* Less than RM1 million.

#### Derivative financial instruments – forward foreign exchange contracts

The Group enters into these contracts with creditworthy financial institutions to minimise the credit risks. The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by the above parties to be unlikely. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of those financial instruments.

#### **(c) Liquidity risk**

The objectives of the Group's and of the Company's liquidity risk management policies are to monitor rolling forecasts of the Group's and of the Company's liquidity requirements to ensure they have sufficient cash to meet operational and investment needs as and when they fall due, availability of funding via credit lines, whilst meeting external debt covenant compliance. The Group and the Company are exposed to liquidity risk where there may be difficulty in raising funds to meet such financial commitments.

### **34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

#### **(d) Capital risk management**

The Group's and the Company's objective when managing capital is to safeguard their ability to continue as a going concern whilst providing sustainable returns for shareholders and maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to optimise its capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, increase or reduce borrowings, issue new shares or return capital to shareholders.

Under the requirement of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad Practice Note No. 17/2005, the Company is required to maintain a consolidated shareholders' equity of more than 25% of the share capital (excluding treasury shares) and maintain such shareholders' equity of not less than RM40 million. The Company has complied with this requirement.

External lenders require the borrower, MBSB, to maintain financial covenant ratios on its net debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest expense. These financial covenant ratios have been fully complied with by MBSB for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.

The Group also monitors its capital structure which comprises borrowings and equity on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity attributable to equity holders of the Company. Net debt is calculated as total interest-bearing financial liabilities comprising the sum of borrowings and derivative financial instruments designated in hedging relationship on borrowings on a net basis (if any) but excluding trade payables under supplier financing as disclosed in Note 29 to the financial statements less deposits, cash and bank balances. Total equity is calculated as 'equity' as shown in the statements of financial position. The gearing ratios at reporting dates were as follows:

|                                                            |      | Group              |                    |  |

| Total interest bearing financial liabilities               |      | 9,289              | 9,772              |  |

#### **(e) Fair value estimation**

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

### **INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MAXIS BERHAD (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) REGISTRATION NO. 200901024473 (867573-A)**

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

#### **Our opinion**

In our opinion, the financial statements of Maxis Berhad ("the Company") and its subsidiaries ("the Group") give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

#### **What we have audited**

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 93 to 181.

#### **Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

#### Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

#### **Our audit approach**

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

#### **Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

#### **Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon**

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Report, Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control and other sections of the Integrated Annual Report 2024, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

#### **Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements**

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

### **Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- (a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- (b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.
- (c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.

#### **REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

#### **Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)**

- (d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- (e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- (f) Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the Group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

#### **REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 18 to the financial statements.

#### **OTHER MATTERS**

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

#### **EXPLANATORY NOTES**

- A. This Agenda item is meant for discussion only as under the provisions of Section 340(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2016 ("CA 2016") and the Constitution of the Company, the audited financial statements do not require the formal approval of shareholders and hence, the matter will not be put forward for voting.
- B. (i) **Ordinary Resolution 1**: Datuk Johan bin Idris was appointed as a Director of the Company on 1 March 2025. He is due for retirement pursuant to Rule 116 of the Constitution of the Company and being eligible, is standing for re-election.

To determine the eligibility of each of the retiring Directors (referred to in Ordinary Resolutions 1, 2, 3 and 4) standing for re-election at the 16th AGM, the Board, through its Nomination and Remuneration Committee ("NRC"), had assessed each of the retiring Directors, and considered the following:

- (i) level of contribution to the Board and deliberations through their skills, experience and strength in qualities;
- (ii) level of objectivity, impartiality and their abilities to act in the best interests of the Company; and
- (iii) the retiring Directors' fit and properness in accordance with the Fit and Proper Policy.

#### In addition:

- 1. For the retiring Directors standing for re-election under Ordinary Resolutions 2, 3 and 4, the NRC and Board reviewed their performance and contribution based on the independent evaluation results of the Board and Directors' Effectiveness Evaluation ("BDEE") 2024 as facilitated by the Institute of Corporate Directors Malaysia.
- 2. The NRC and the Board, in line with Practice 6.1 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance ("MCCG"), had assessed all the Directors of the Company based on the relevant performance criteria which include the following:

	- b) Character and integrity in dealing with potential conflict of interest situations;
	- c) Commitment to serve the Company, due diligence and integrity;

	- f) Fit and properness;
	- g) Calibre and personality;
	- h) Board dynamics and participation;
	- i) Independence and objectivity; and
	- j) Contribution and performance.

The NRC and the Board have considered the results of the assessment conducted on the retiring Directors and collectively agreed that they each meet the criteria of character, experience, integrity, competence and time required to effectively discharge their respective roles as Directors as prescribed under Paragraph 2.20A of the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad Main Market Listing Requirements ("MMLR"), and additionally have satisfied the Directors' fit and proper assessment criteria. The retiring Directors met the performance criteria required of an effective and a high-performance Board.

The Board approved the NRC's recommendation that the retiring Directors, namely Datuk Johan bin Idris, Uthaya Kumar A/L K Vivekananda, Ooi Huey Tyng and Lim Ghee Keong are eligible to stand for re-election.

The retiring Directors have abstained from deliberations and decisions on their respective eligibility and suitability to stand for re-election at the relevant NRC and Board meetings. The profiles and conflict of interest disclosures of the retiring Directors are set out on pages 60, 61 and 64 of the Company's Integrated Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.

D. The Audit and Risk Committee ("ARC") and the Board have considered the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT ("PwC") as Auditors of the Company and collectively agreed that PwC meets the criteria prescribed by Paragraph 15.21 of the MMLR.

The ARC, at its meeting held on 11 February 2025, had assessed the suitability and independence of the external auditors, PwC in accordance with the External Auditor Independence Policy of the Group and the criteria under Paragraph 15.21 of the MMLR. It had also considered the information presented by PwC in its 2024 Audit Transparency Report as per Guidance 9.3 of the MCCG.

The ARC was satisfied with the suitability of PwC based on the quality of audit, performance, competency, experience and sufficiency of resources the external audit team provided to the Maxis Group. The ARC was also satisfied in its review that the provisions of non-audit services by PwC to the Company and the Group for the financial year ended 2024 did not impair their objectivity and independence as external auditors of the Maxis Group.

The Board, at its meeting held on 12 February 2025, approved the ARC's recommendation for shareholders' approval to be sought at the 16th AGM for the re-appointment of PwC as external auditors of the Company for the financial year ending 2025, in accordance with Rule 90 of the Constitution of the Company, Section 340(1)(c) and Section 274(1)(a) of the CA 2016.

E. Dato' Hamidah binti Naziadin ("DHN") was appointed as Independent Director on 1 February 2014 and has exceeded a cumulative tenure of nine (9) years. Pursuant to the shareholders' approval obtained at the Company's 15th Annual General Meeting held on 16 May 2024, DHN was authorised to continue serving on the Board as Independent Director until 17 May 2025.

In accordance with the MCCG, the Board, through the NRC, undertook relevant assessments and recommended for DHN to continue to serve as Independent Non-Executive Director from 18 May 2025 until 31 January 2026, after which she will reach her twelve (12)-year tenure as an Independent Director and would no longer be regarded as an Independent Director pursuant to the MMLR.

DHN has abstained from deliberation and voting at the relevant NRC and Board meetings in respect of the recommendation on DHN's continuation to act as an Independent Director of the Company.

The NRC and Board's recommendations are based on the following justifications:

- (a) DHN has fulfilled the criteria of an Independent Director as stated in the MMLR. She has demonstrated her objectivity and independence both in substance and form. DHN is not hesitant to challenge the rest of the Board members and Management team while discharging her responsibilities as a Director and previously as Interim Chairman (from 1 July 2024 to 28 February 2025), and when considering Board/Committee matters.
- (b) DHN is free from any conflicts of interest. As an Independent Director, Chairman of the NRC, and Member of the ARC, DHN provides constructive independent counsel to the Board Committees and Board, and guidance to Management in the best interests of Maxis.
- (c) DHN with her expertise in human resources, people management, governance, and corporate social responsibility, brings invaluable insights to the Board. Her extensive cross-industry experience enables her to offer practical counsel, oversight, and strategic guidance in Board and Committee matters. Her impartial insights are crucial for the deliberations of the Board and its Committees. DHN also has experience mentoring and coaching young talent and women.
- (d) The length of time that DHN has remained in her role has not interfered with her ability to exercise independent judgement as an Independent Director and she has continued to contribute to the performance and positive dynamics of the Board Committees and Board.
- (e) DHN together with the other Independent Directors, each function as a check and balance to the Board and in the exercise of objectivity as Directors.
- (f) DHN has devoted sufficient time and attention to her professional obligations to Maxis required for informed and balanced decision making.

DHN served as Interim Chairman from 1 July 2024 until 28 February 2025 and resumed her role as Independent Non-Executive Director following the appointment of Datuk Johan bin Idris as Chairman on 1 March 2025.

The Board continues to dedicate its efforts in searching the market for suitably qualified Independent Directors, including women directors who fulfil the required attributes and who can contribute to Maxis in its growth strategy. Board appointments are based on merits, skills, experience, gaps in Board composition and requirements of Maxis.

The NRC and Board are satisfied that DHN consistently demonstrates independent judgement and acts in the best interests of the Company.

DHN's profile is set out on page 60 of the Company's Integrated Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2024. DHN does not hold any shares in Maxis, has no family relationship with any Director and/or major shareholder of Maxis, has no conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest including any interest in any competing business with Maxis or its subsidiaries, has not been convicted of any offence within the past five (5) years and has not been imposed with any penalty by the relevant regulatory bodies during the financial year ended 2024.

F. Authority to allot and issue shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the CA 2016.

Ordinary Resolution 8 is for the purpose of renewing the general mandate for issuance of shares by the Company pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the CA 2016.

The Company did not issue any shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the CA 2016 under the general mandate sought at the 15th Annual General Meeting held on 16 May 2024, which will lapse upon the conclusion of the forthcoming 16th AGM to be held on 15 May 2025.

The proposed resolution, if passed, will give authority to the Directors of the Company, from the date of this Annual General Meeting, to allot and issue shares or to make or grant offers, agreements, rights or options in respect of shares to such persons in their absolute discretion, including to make or grant offers, agreements, rights or options which would or might require shares in the Company to be issued after the expiration of the approval, without having to convene a

general meeting, provided that the aggregate number of shares issued does not exceed 10% of the total number of issued shares of the Company for the time being. This authority, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.

The general mandate sought will enable the Directors of the Company to allot and issue shares, including but not limited to making placement of shares for the purposes of raising funding for investment(s), working capital and general corporate purposes as deemed necessary.
