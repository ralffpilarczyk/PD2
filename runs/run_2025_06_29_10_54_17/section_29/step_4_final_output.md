This analysis provides a buyside due diligence assessment of Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance, focusing on critical issues and challenging management's narrative.

## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation's operational context is defined by two contrasting elements: the **cessation of its supply chain management services segment amidst an ongoing investigation**, posing immediate due diligence priorities regarding liabilities and reputational damage, and a positive trajectory in its core **manufacturing segment**. The company attributes the supply chain exit to "reallocation of resources," yet the investigation suggests a forced rather than strategic divestment. The manufacturing segment, conversely, shows robust revenue growth, expanding gross profit margins, and reduced environmental intensity, indicative of strategic pivots towards high-precision manufacturing and efficiency investments (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.30).

### Top 3 Most Important Operating Metrics:

For buyside due diligence, the most impactful operating metrics are **Manufacturing Revenue Growth**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **GHG Emissions Intensity**. While GHG intensity carries growing ESG importance with quantifiable cost/revenue implications, its direct economic materiality is less than core efficiency metrics (e.g., Capacity Utilization, Inventory Turnover), for which data is currently unavailable. This absence is a key information gap for assessing overall asset efficiency and working capital management.

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue Growth

This metric reflects market demand, sales effectiveness, and market share from core manufacturing operations. A disaggregation between volume and pricing changes is not provided, obscuring the true nature of growth.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                | Period  | Value (S$ Million) | Growth (%)       | Source                               |
|:----------------------|:--------|:-------------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Manufacturing Revenue | FY2023  | 103.9              |                  | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4 |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H1 2023 | 52.6               |                  | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)*    |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H2 2023 | 51.3               |                  | Fu Yu FS Q44, p.13                   |
| Manufacturing Revenue | FY2024  | 114.9              | 10.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4 |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H1 2024 | 54.8               | 4.06% (YoY H1)   | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)*    |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H2 2024 | 60.1               | 17.18% (YoY H2)  | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                  |

**Analysis of Drivers & Scrutiny:** Growth (10.5% YoY in FY2024) is attributed to "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects in biomedical and consumer segments" enabled by NPI teams and advanced tooling (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). The lack of volume/pricing disaggregation hinders understanding of growth sustainability. A concerning 11.8% decline in China operations (offset by Singapore/Malaysia growth) is cited by management as "slower-than-expected recovery," but requires independent verification for customer losses, pricing pressure, or strategic reprioritization (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31). Management points to a "20% YoY increase in FY2024 order book" and "sticky" high-precision projects, but the *firmness* of this order book and its historical *conversion rate* to revenue are critical for validation.

**Quantification of Financial Impact:** The S$11.0 million manufacturing revenue growth in FY2024 significantly drove the Group's overall S$0.9 million revenue increase, offsetting a S$10.0 million decline from the discontinued supply chain segment. This growth was instrumental in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million (FY2023) to S$1.2 million (FY2024) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7).

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  **Order Book Validation:** What is the specific breakdown of the 20% YoY order book increase by customer/segment, its binding nature, and anticipated revenue conversion rate for FY2025/2026? What is the *historical* conversion rate?
2.  **China Operations:** Beyond general economic recovery, what specific factors (e.g., customer churn, competitive pricing) drove the 11.8% China decline? What concrete plans are in place to mitigate future risk and establish a recovery timeline?
3.  **Pricing vs. Volume:** Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing revenue growth attributable to unit volume increases versus average selling price changes?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

Manufacturing GPM reflects pricing power, cost control, and core production profitability.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric            | Period  | Value   | Change (ppt) | Source                          |
|:------------------|:--------|:--------|:-------------|:--------------------------------|
| Manufacturing GPM | FY2023  | 11.7%   |              | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7                |
| Manufacturing GPM | H1 2023 | 9.7%    |              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing GPM | H2 2023 | 13.6%   |              | (Calculated)**                  |
| Manufacturing GPM | FY2024  | 13.5%   | +1.8 ppt     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7                |
| Manufacturing GPM | H1 2024 | 12.8%   |              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing GPM | H2 2024 | 14.1%   |              | (Calculated)**                  |

**Analysis of Drivers & Scrutiny:** The 1.8 ppt GPM improvement (FY2023 to FY2024) aligns with a "strategic shift towards higher-margin product categories" and "high-precision manufacturing" enabled by the NPI team (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). However, the *specific cost structures* and *market defensibility* of these "higher-margin" products are unclear. The consistent lower GPM in H1 compared to H2 across both years suggests potential seasonality (e.g., product mix, inventory revaluations, fixed cost absorption) that requires investigation for consistent profitability assessment. Proactive strategies for managing raw material costs and labor productivity beyond product mix are not detailed. Sustained GPM improvement hinges on continued success in securing high-precision projects and moving "up the value chain" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:** The 1.8 percentage point GPM increase resulted in an S$3.4 million rise in manufacturing gross profit (S$15.5M in FY2024 vs. S$12.1M in FY2023). This was a key factor in narrowing the Group's net loss from continuing operations.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  **Margin Drivers Detail:** Provide a segment-level gross profit margin breakdown by key product categories (e.g., medical devices, consumer products) and clarify *what specific factors* make these categories "higher-margin."
2.  **Cost Management Strategies:** What specific strategies are in place for managing raw material costs (e.g., hedging, supplier diversification) and labor productivity (e.g., automation, training) to sustain GPM as volumes increase?
3.  **Seasonal/Fluctuation Analysis:** What drives the consistent H1/H2 GPM variation, and how does management plan to mitigate this volatility or leverage it?

### 3. GHG Emissions Intensity (Manufacturing Segment)

GHG Emissions Intensity (tCO2e per S$ million of manufacturing revenue) indicates environmental efficiency, compliance risk, and potential for energy cost savings and brand reputation benefits.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                        | Period | Value (tCO2e/S$ mil revenue) | Reduction (%) | Source          |
|:------------------------------|:-------|:-----------------------------|:--------------|:----------------|
| GHG Emissions Intensity       | FY2023 | 214.4                        |               | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| GHG Emissions Intensity       | FY2024 | 191.9                        | 10.5% (YoY)   | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| Total Electricity Consumption | FY2023 | 116,481.6 GJ                 |               | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |
| Total Electricity Consumption | FY2024 | 113,623.0 GJ                 | 2.5% (YoY)    | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |

**Analysis of Drivers & Scrutiny:** The 10.5% YoY reduction stems from energy efficiency (new machines, LED lighting, 2.5% decrease in purchased electricity) and renewable energy adoption (solar panel installation in Singapore, 4,001.8 GJ generated on-site) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 38). While positive for ESG, the *economic materiality* of these improvements on the P&L needs to be quantified relative to other operational levers, especially given capital expenditure involved. This trend is sustainable given ongoing strategic investments and explicit targets (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.17).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:** The 2.5% reduction in purchased electricity (2,858.6 GJ saved) contributes directly to energy cost savings (estimated S$143,000, assuming S$0.18/kWh). Solar energy generation (4,001.8 GJ) further reduces grid reliance. The sale of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for 3,996.0 GJ in FY2024 offers a direct *revenue opportunity* (estimated S$36,000, assuming S$9/REC) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.37). Indirectly, these practices may improve access to green financing and investor confidence. While beneficial, the *overall financial impact* on the P&L is less significant than core revenue and GPM drivers for a manufacturing firm.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  **Energy Cost Savings & Unit Costs:** Provide a detailed breakdown of actual and projected energy cost savings (in S$ terms) for FY2024/FY2025 by region, quantifying their impact on the overall cost per unit of production.
2.  **Capex & ROI for Decarbonization:** What is the detailed roadmap and capital expenditure plan to achieve the 30% Scope 2 emissions reduction target by FY2030, including specific technology upgrades, estimated costs, and anticipated financial returns (ROI) on these investments, especially against other potential capital deployments?
3.  **Green Financing Impact:** Has the reduced GHG intensity directly led to lower cost of capital or specific green financing opportunities, and how is this quantified?
