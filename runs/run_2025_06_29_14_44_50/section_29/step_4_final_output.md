## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's core manufacturing segment has demonstrated a positive trajectory over the last 24 months, with robust revenue growth, significant gross profit margin (GPM) expansion, and a strong increase in its order book. This indicates improving operational efficiency and market traction, crucial given the strategic discontinuation of its supply chain management (SCM) services, which significantly masked Group-level growth.

This analysis focuses on three critical operating metrics: **Manufacturing Revenue**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **Order Book Growth**. While these metrics reflect market traction, pricing power, cost efficiency, and future revenue potential, a key limitation for buy-side due diligence is the absence of quantifiable market share, comprehensive asset utilization rates, and direct industry benchmarks from public documents, severely limiting external comparative analysis.

### Key Operating Performance Metrics (FY2023 vs. FY2024)

| Metric                     | FY2023 (S$M/%) | FY2024 (S$M/%) | YoY Growth/Î” | Source                                 |
| :------------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Manufacturing Revenue      | 103.94 S$M     | 114.89 S$M     | +10.5%       | Fu Yu 24 AR, p6                        |
| Manufacturing GPM (Note 1) | 17.5%          | 20.3%          | +2.8 pp      | Fu Yu FS Q424, p4,6                    |
| Order Book Growth          | N/A            | N/A            | +20% (YoY)   | Fu Yu 24 AR, p6 (No monetary value)    |

*Note 1: Fu Yu 24 AR (p7) explicitly reports Manufacturing GPM as 11.7% (FY23) and 13.5% (FY24). This significant discrepancy requires immediate clarification.*

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue

Manufacturing Revenue grew 10.5% YoY to S$114.89 million in FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p6], crucial in offsetting the SCM segment's decline and leading to a marginal 0.5% overall Group revenue increase [Fu Yu 24 AR, p7]. Growth drivers include higher order volumes from existing customers and new project wins in higher-margin categories like biomedical and medical devices. Strategic investments in advanced tooling and a New Product Introduction (NPI) team supported these wins [Fu Yu 24 AR, p6]. A geographical shift saw increased sales from Singapore (+20.9%) and Malaysia (+24.9%) offsetting a decline in China operations (-11.8%) [Fu Yu 24 AR, p8]. *Critical Due Diligence Gap:* It's unclear if the China decline represents customer attrition or merely a relocation of existing customer production away from China to Fu Yu's other facilities. This distinction is critical for assessing true customer stickiness.

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

Manufacturing GPM expanded significantly from a calculated 17.5% in FY2023 to 20.3% in FY2024, adding S$5.03 million to gross profit. This expansion is primarily attributed to an improved product mix towards higher-value, higher-margin projects. *Major Analytical Gap/Red Flag:* This calculated GPM significantly diverges from the 11.7% (FY23) and 13.5% (FY24) explicitly reported in the Fu Yu 24 AR (p7). This discrepancy demands immediate clarification. Additionally, claims of lower production costs in Singapore and Malaysia compared to China for the current product mix are highly counter-intuitive for manufacturing and require deep investigation into underlying cost structures by region and product line. Unquantified claims of operational efficiency gains (e.g., reduced energy intensity) also limit independent verification.

### 3. Order Book Growth

Fu Yu reports a "strong increase in order book," up 20% year-on-year by the end of FY2024, driven by new project wins and deepening customer relationships [Fu Yu 24 AR, p6]. These projects are expected to transition into long-term revenue streams. *Critical Analytical Limitation:* Public documents provide no quantifiable data (monetary value, volume, or duration) for the order book. This prevents independent verification of future revenue visibility and the "highly sustainable" nature claimed by the Company, constituting a significant red flag for a buyer.

### Key Due Diligence Questions:

*   Reconcile the significant discrepancy in reported Manufacturing GPM figures (calculated vs. AR stated).
*   Provide a granular breakdown of production costs by region (China vs. SG/MY) and product line, justifying lower costs outside China.
*   Quantify manufacturing revenue growth by volume increases from existing customers, new customer acquisition, and pricing adjustments.
*   Can management provide a quantified breakdown of the current order book by value, customer type (new vs. existing), key product category, and expected revenue recognition timeline (e.g., 12-month, 24-month, 36-month pipeline)?
*   Clarify if the decline in China operations represents customer attrition or a strategic shift of existing customers' production to other Fu Yu facilities.
