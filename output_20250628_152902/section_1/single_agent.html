        <li><b>Automation and Digitalization:</b> The Group completed most of the testing for its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform in FY2024, aiming to increase toolroom automation levels by 40% to reduce downtime. There is also an active transition from hydraulic machinery to energy-efficient electric alternatives to enhance operational efficiency. <a href="#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Renewable Energy Integration:</b> Installation of solar panels was completed in Singapore facilities in FY2024, and in Fu Hao, Malaysia, by Q4 FY2024. Panels in Classic Advantage, Malaysia, are expected to be operational by Q2 FY2025. This supports a greener footprint and reduces reliance on conventional energy. <a href="#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Order Book Growth:</b> The Group's order book increased 20% year-on-year at the end of FY2024, reflecting higher order volumes and interest from existing customers and new project wins. <a href="#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Reduction in Waste:</b> Hazardous waste decreased by 25.7% in FY2024 due to fewer large tonnage machine oil changes. Non-hazardous waste also declined, attributed to improved production efficiency and waste reduction initiatives. <a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a></li>

    <h3>e. How the operating structure supports competitive positioning</h3>
    <p>Fu Yu's operating structure is designed to leverage its long-standing expertise and advanced capabilities to maintain a competitive edge:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vertically-Integrated Services:</b> Offering a one-stop solution from product and tooling design, fabrication, production (plastic and metal injection moulding), to assembly and testing enhances value-add for customers and fosters long-term partnerships. <a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Technological Leadership:</b> The flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, with its 100K-class cleanroom, high-precision tooling, and 3D metal printing capabilities, positions Fu Yu as one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities. This supports the production of complex, high-margin products in sectors like life sciences and medical. <a href="#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>New Product Introduction (NPI) Team:</b> The NPI team adds value in the early stages of the business cycle, building customer confidence for scaling production while maintaining quality. This has led to securing new projects in medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances. <a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Geographical Flexibility:</b> With manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China, the Group offers geographical flexibility, a critical advantage for customers seeking to diversify production away from China amidst geopolitical uncertainties. <a href="#footnote51"><sup>51</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Operational Excellence and Efficiency:</b> Investments in Industry 4.0 machinery, the ERP system for increased automation, and the transition to electric machinery reduce downtime and improve efficiency. The focus on stabilizing 5-micron precision levels and moving to higher precision enhances product quality and competitiveness. <a href="#footnote52"><sup>52</sup></a></li>
        <li><b>Quality and Environmental Certifications:</b> Extensive ISO and IATF certifications (ISO 9001, ISO 13485 for medical, ISO 14001 for environmental, IATF 16949 for automotive) demonstrate a commitment to quality and compliance across diverse industries, reinforcing customer trust and access to regulated markets. <a href="#footnote53"><sup>53</sup></a></li>

Operating Segments" table, "Capital expenditure**" row for Twelve Months Ended 31 Dec 2023. Note: This table's FY2023 CAPEX is 3,735, which differs from AR 3,962. I'll stick to the AR's cash flow statement as the primary source for actual cash flow data. However, the note explicitly states "Capital expenditure**" which excludes ROU, and the table in AR p.114 is "Net cash outflow for purchase of property, plant and equipment" which also excludes ROU. I will use the AR's reported figure of 3,962 for FY2023. For FY2022, the only direct number in the provided docs for CAPEX seems to be 3,735 from the Segment Info table in FS Q424_m.md page 24. It is marked "** Excluding addition of right-of-use assets." For consistency, I will use this value for FY2022.</li>
