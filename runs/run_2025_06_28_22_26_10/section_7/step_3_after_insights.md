## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

### 1. Executive Summary

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") experienced a mixed financial performance, with its core Manufacturing segment showing resilience and growth, particularly in FY2024. This analysis focuses on key financial metrics for the last three fiscal years and four most recent interim periods, drawing primarily from the company's financial disclosures. While efforts have been made to extract all available data, specific industry comparison data was not provided in the source material. Data for a fifth interim period (e.g., H1 or H2 2022) was not available, and comprehensive FY2022 annual data for certain metrics was also not explicitly provided, limiting a full three-year trend analysis. Overall consolidated results have been significantly impacted by the cessation and financial irregularities of the Supply Chain Management Services segment (FYSCS), leading to an auditor's qualified opinion on the financial statements for FY2024. While the Manufacturing segment returned to profitability at the pre-tax level in FY2024, the consolidated Group remained in a net loss position, albeit narrowed. Cash flow from operations improved, but significant volatility and ongoing investigations present both opportunities and substantial, unquantified risks for future performance and shareholder value.

#### c. Key Recent Trends

1.  **Revenue Shift & Growth:** Overall Group revenue saw only a marginal 0.5% increase in FY2024 compared to FY2023, despite strong growth in the Manufacturing segment (up 10.5% in FY2024). The Supply Chain Management Services segment (FYSCS) saw a decline in revenue and was discontinued in Q4 FY2024, leading to a significant 45.8% drop in overall Group revenue in 2H2024. While the core manufacturing business demonstrated consistent quarterly growth throughout FY2024 (S$52.6M in 1H23 to S$60.1M in 2H24), the overall Group top-line remains largely stagnant and faces a significant revenue hole from the FYSCS exit. The manufacturing segment will need to accelerate growth substantially to compensate for this.
2.  **Profitability Turnaround (Manufacturing) - Nuance Needed:** The Manufacturing segment (continuing operations) made a notable shift from a substantial loss before tax of S\$8.1 million in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S\$0.15 million in FY2024 (AR p.108). This was largely due to higher revenue and a significant reduction in selling and administrative expenses (down 20.4%). EBITDA from continuing operations also increased dramatically from S$0.6M in FY2023 to S$8.5M in FY2024. **However, despite this operational improvement, Net Income (Cont. Ops) remained negative (S$1.2M loss in FY2024, and S$0.5M loss in both 1H24 and 2H24).** This indicates that while manufacturing operations are becoming profitable, the segment is still burdened by significant corporate overheads, unallocated finance costs, or tax expenses that erode its bottom-line profitability, suggesting the "turnaround" is not fully complete at the net profit level.
3.  **Consolidated Loss & Discontinuation Impact:** Despite the manufacturing segment's recovery at the PBT level, the consolidated Group recorded a net loss of S\$3.9 million in FY2024, though sharply narrowed from S\$10.1 million in FY2023. This consolidated loss is primarily attributable to the loss from discontinued operations (FYSCS), which accounted for S\$2.7 million in FY2024 (FS Q424 p.4). The discontinuation and related impairments significantly weighed on the overall financial results, revealing the negative impact of the non-core segment.
4.  **Improving Margins (Post-FYSCS):** The Group's gross profit margin improved from 7.0% in FY2023 to 8.9% in FY2024 (AR p.7). The Manufacturing segment's gross margin specifically improved from 11.7% to 13.5% (AR p.7). This trend is expected to continue as the low-margin, problematic FYSCS business is removed from the consolidated results. EBITDA margin for continuing operations also saw a significant jump, reflecting improved operational efficiency, largely benefiting from the elimination of FYSCS.

#### d. Cash Flow Assessment

1.  **Operating Cash Flow Improvement:** The Group successfully transitioned from a net operating cash outflow of S\$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S\$3.6 million in FY2024 (AR p.111, FS Q424 p.10). This positive shift indicates better working capital management (decrease in inventories and trade receivables) and a reduction in operational losses in continuing operations.
2.  **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Capex significantly increased from S\$4.0 million in FY2023 to S\$6.9 million in FY2024, representing a higher percentage of total revenue (from 2.1% to 3.6%). This reflects strategic investments in factory equipment, plant, and machinery, particularly for the Smart Factory in Singapore (AR p.9, Pres H124 p.9). This aligns with management's stated focus on high-precision manufacturing.
3.  **Cash Conversion Fluctuations & Concerns:** Cash conversion (Net Operating Cash Flow / Total Group EBITDA) was highly negative in FY2023 due to significant operating cash outflows and low EBITDA (driven by substantial working capital outflows, e.g., increase in receivables/inventory in the troubled FYSCS segment). It recovered to 37.4% for FY2024, indicating improved efficiency in converting earnings into cash. **However, the 2H24 period saw a slight operating cash outflow, resulting in negative cash conversion for that specific half (-1.0%).** This late-year reversal in cash flow, occurring post-FYSCS cessation, is a significant red flag, suggesting that the cash generation capabilities are not yet stable, and may reflect new working capital dynamics (e.g., increased inventory or receivables from growing manufacturing operations) or one-off transition costs. Such volatility impacts the sustainability of funding future Capex from internal operations.
4.  **Strong Net Cash Position:** Despite the losses and investments, the Group maintained a healthy net cash position of S\$55.5 million as at 31 December 2024 (AR p.8, FS Q424 p.3). This provides crucial financial flexibility for ongoing operations, strategic initiatives, and potential legal costs related to the FYSCS investigation.

#### e. Industry Context (Qualitative)

Fu Yu's reported manufacturing segment gross margin of 13.5% in FY2024, and the significant improvement in EBITDA margin for continuing operations to 7.4%, suggest a positive trend in operational efficiency. Without direct industry comparisons, it is challenging to definitively assess if these margins are above, below, or in line with industry averages for similar high-precision manufacturing services, though the trend indicates a solid internal return to core business profitability. The increased capital expenditure aligns with the industry's need for ongoing investment in advanced machinery to maintain competitiveness and pursue higher-value projects.

### 3. MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

#### a. 2 Key Achievements

1.  **Successful Turnaround of Core Manufacturing Business (FY2024):** The Group's strategic transformation efforts have clearly paid off in its core manufacturing segment. Revenue grew by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, driven by new projects in biomedical and consumer segments and higher order volumes from existing customers (Chairman's Message, AR p.6; Financial Highlights, AR p.7). More impressively, the manufacturing segment reversed a significant loss before tax of S$8.1 million in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S$0.15 million in FY2024 (FS Q424 p.4). This achievement is a direct result of "advanced tooling with high precision and the introduction of our New Product Introduction ("NPI") team" (Chairman's Message, AR p.6). This shift validates their focus on high-precision manufacturing.
2.  **Significant Improvement in Operational Efficiency and Cash Flow Generation:** Selling and administrative expenses for continuing operations decreased by a substantial 20.4% in FY2024, contributing to the improved profitability (Financial Highlights, AR p.7). Concurrently, the Group successfully converted a net operating cash outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024 (AR p.9, FS Q424 p.10). This indicates enhanced working capital management and cost containment, crucial for sustainable operations amidst challenging environments.

#### b. 2 Key Challenges

1.  **Discontinuation and Financial Impact of Supply Chain Segment (FYSCS):** The Group ceased all business activities in its supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) in Q4 FY2024 due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" (FS Q424 p.26). This decision led to a significant loss from discontinued operations of S$2.7 million in FY2024, impacting overall consolidated profitability (FS Q44 p.4). This reflects not just talent acquisition issues but a strategic misstep into a non-core business that became a substantial financial drain.
2.  **Ongoing Investigation and Audit Qualification Related to FYSCS:** This is the most critical challenge. The external auditor issued a **"Qualified Opinion"** on the FY2024 financial statements specifically due to an "ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd" (Independent Auditor's Report, AR p.104). The investigation highlights serious concerns including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of the email account," and "irregular expense claims" (Directors' Statement, AR p.100; FS Q424 p.28). This points to serious corporate governance failures and potential financial misconduct, not merely an operational challenge. It poses a significant and unquantified financial and reputational risk from "claims against certain persons" (AR p.100, Note 32) and impacts the reliability of the financial statements.

#### c. 2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance/Data

1.  **Management's Portrayal vs. Auditor's Qualification on FYSCS:**
    *   **Management Statement:** The Chairman's message positively frames the cessation of FYSCS as a strategic move to "reallocate resources to our core manufacturing business" and that "these investigations are isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations" (Chairman's Message, AR p.6). The interim report also states the cessation was due to "inability to identify a suitable candidate" (FS Q424 p.26).
    *   **Actual Performance/Data Disconnect:** This constitutes a significant **selective narrative framing and an attempt at reputational damage control**. The auditor's qualified opinion directly contradicts the "isolated" narrative by stating they "were unable to determine the potential financial impact, if any, to the Group and the Company in respect of the Claims which pertain to FYSCS" (Independent Auditor's Report, AR p.104). The detailed allegations of "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," and "irregular expense claims" (FS Q424 p.28) strongly suggest **fraud or severe mismanagement**, far more serious than a simple talent issue. The S$3.3M goodwill impairment in FY2024 for FYSCS directly preceded its cessation, suggesting underlying issues were already present. **So What:** Management's downplaying of the severity of the FYSCS issues creates a major overhang of unquantified financial risk (e.g., potential legal costs, fines, write-offs of unrecoverable amounts) and fundamentally challenges the reliability of the financial statements and overall corporate governance, eroding investor trust.
2.  **Revenue Growth Narrative vs. Consolidated Topline Stagnation:**
    *   **Management Statement:** The Chairman's message highlights "revenue from our continuing operations (manufacturing) grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million in FY2024" (AR p.6). The 1H2024 review also states "Group-wide revenue rose 78.0%, propelled by higher sales for both manufacturing and supply chain management segments" (Pres H124 p.5). The FY2025 outlook forecasts a "20% year-on-year" increase in order book and overall "financial performance... will improve" (FS Q424 p.31).
    *   **Actual Performance/Data Disconnect:** While the manufacturing segment indeed grew, the *total consolidated Group revenue* only increased by a marginal 0.5% for FY2024 (AR p.7). The significant 78.0% growth in 1H2024 was heavily influenced by the volatile FYSCS segment which then drastically declined in 2H2024, causing the overall 2H2024 Group revenue to drop by 45.8% (FS Q424 p.4). **So What:** This is a clear case of **selective focus and potentially misleading optimism**. The emphasis on manufacturing growth, while accurate for the segment, obscures the reality that the overall top-line for the group is largely stagnant year-on-year and faces a steep decline in 2H2024 due to strategic decisions about FYSCS. The forward-looking optimism for FY2025, while linked to the manufacturing order book, does not explicitly quantify how the absence of the (albeit problematic) FYSCS revenue, or the potential financial impact of the FYSCS investigation, will factor into the overall Group's "improved financial performance." This suggests the manufacturing segment must achieve exceptionally high growth just to offset the revenue gap left by FYSCS, posing a significant challenge to overall Group growth in the near term.
