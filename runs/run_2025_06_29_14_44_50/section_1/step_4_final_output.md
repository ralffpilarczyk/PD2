## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

**Executive Summary:**

Fu Yu ("Group") operates 6 high-precision plastic/metal manufacturing sites (over 1.5M sq ft) across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, anchored by its advanced Smart Factory. Strategic shifts include reducing China reliance and pivoting to higher-value sectors (biomedical, EVs), emphasizing automation/sustainability. Critically, FY2024 saw the cessation of its supply chain management services (Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd, "FYSCS"), which, while framed as resource reallocation, is under investigation for internal control weaknesses and purported misuse of resources, leading to an auditor's qualified opinion. This signals a potential governance crisis and financial uncertainty with undisclosed liabilities. While its operating structure supports competitive positioning, challenges in employee retention and training hours introduce execution risks contradicting its high-precision pivot.

### a. Key Operating Metrics & Human Capital Paradox

FY2024 saw a 7.8% reduction in Group headcount, with China operations significantly reduced and Singapore expanding, reflecting a pivot to higher-value activities.

**Analysis:**
Despite its strategic pivot to high-precision sectors, a high turnover rate (24.9%) coupled with reduced average training hours (16.0 to 13.2) presents a stark contradiction. Management's "training budget control" (FY24 AR, p.56) risks eroding specialized skills, potentially leading to increased error rates and product defects in precision manufacturing, and making Fu Yu a less attractive employer.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance, and Ownership

The Group's manufacturing facilities, anchored by its Singapore Smart Factory, are critical assets supporting vertical integration and a pivot to high-value sectors. Investments in advanced capabilities (e.g., solar panels) aim for efficiency and sustainability, though capacity utilization remains undisclosed.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Strategic Alignment

The Group's geographic footprint across Singapore, Malaysia, and China is actively re-aligned to mitigate geopolitical risks and capitalize on new market opportunities.

**Manufacturing Revenue Contribution by Geography:**

| Malaysia  | 36.6         | 18.8       | 17.8       | 29.3         | 16.5       | 12.8       | 31.9%                   | 28.2%                   | +3.7                         | 36.6M (FY2024)           | FY24 AR, p.8; FS Q424, p.17; Pres 1H24, p.5                         |

**Analysis:**
Revenue shifts confirm strategic re-alignment: Singapore and Malaysia gained 7.1 percentage points, directly offsetting China's decline. This diversification responds to "geopolitical uncertainty" (FY24 AR, p.6). However, the analysis lacks scrutiny of financial implications. Higher labor costs in Singapore/Malaysia and unaddressed supply chain/logistics shifts raise critical questions about potential margin compression if increased revenue doesn't translate proportionally into higher profitability.

### d. Significant Changes and Competitive Positioning

Significant changes mark the Group's operating footprint. The cessation of its supply chain management services (FYSCS), contributing 39.9% of FY2024 Group revenue (FY24 AR, p.8), was framed as resource reallocation. However, an ongoing investigation into internal control weaknesses and purported misuse of resources, leading to a qualified auditor's opinion (FY24 AR, p.6, p.104), indicates a severe governance crisis with undisclosed liabilities. While a 20% year-on-year order book increase (FY24 AR, p.6) signals traction, its sustainability is questionable given headcount reduction and the human capital paradox; undisclosed capacity utilization further complicates assessing efficient delivery. The strategic pivot to high-precision manufacturing (medical devices, drone technology) and increased automation (Smart Factory, Industry 4.0, ERP) (FY24 AR, p.6) aim to enhance competitive positioning, supported by sustainability integration (reduced energy/water/waste) (FY24 AR, p.36-45). Yet, the FYSCS cessation reveals a governance crisis, starkly contrasting management's narrative. The human capital paradox (reduced training, specialized pivot) threatens quality and talent. Unexplored geographical shift cost implications raise margin compression concerns. Overall, strong assets and strategic direction are undermined by operational and governance disconnects, introducing substantial execution risks warranting skeptical investor scrutiny.
