## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated) - Comprehensive Analysis

### Financial Summary

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's consolidated financial performance for the last two financial years (FY2023, FY2024) and the most recent four interim periods (1H2023, 2H2023, 1H2024, 2H2024) reveals a company in transition, navigating a challenging economic landscape while undertaking strategic shifts. The Group's decision to cease its supply chain management services segment in late FY2024 significantly impacts the consolidated figures, leading to a re-presentation of prior period financials to separate continuing and discontinued operations.

*Note: All financial figures are in thousands of Singapore Dollars (S$'000) unless otherwise stated. Interim period data for 1H2024 and 1H2023 are derived by subtracting 2H figures from the respective full-year figures, or directly from stated H1 figures in Q424 E.11(iii) and Fuyu Pres H124. The company's financial statements re-present discontinued operations, which impacts comparability with previous unadjusted reports.*

#### Key Recent Trends:

1.  **Revenue Growth & Mix Shift**:
    *   **Annual**: Consolidated revenue remained relatively stable year-on-year, increasing marginally by 0.5% to S$191.3 million in FY2024 from S$190.4 million in FY2023 [AR Page 108, Note 17]. This stability masks significant internal shifts. The manufacturing segment's revenue grew by 10.5% in FY2024 (S$114.9 million) from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [AR Page 8], driven by higher order volumes and new projects in medical and consumer segments, particularly in Singapore (+20.9%) and Malaysia (+24.9%) [AR Page 9]. Conversely, the supply chain management services segment, which ceased operations in Q4 FY2024, saw its revenue decline by 11.6% to S$76.4 million in FY2024 from S$86.4 million in FY2023 [AR Page 8].
    *   **Interim**: The first half of FY2024 (1H2024) showed strong revenue growth of 78.0% compared to 1H2023, reaching S$126.7 million [Q424 E.11(iii) Page 23]. However, the second half of FY2024 (2H2024) experienced a sharp 45.8% decline in revenue to S$64.6 million from S$119.2 million in 2H2023 [Q424 E.11(iii) Page 23]. This dramatic drop in 2H2024 is directly attributable to the cessation of the supply chain management services segment in Q4 FY2024 [Q424 E.10 Page 30].
2.  **Profitability and Margin Evolution**:
    *   **Gross Profit & Margin**: Consolidated gross profit increased by 27.8% to S$17.0 million in FY2024, with the gross profit margin improving to 8.9% from 7.0% in FY2023 [AR Page 8]. This improvement is primarily driven by the manufacturing segment, which saw its gross profit margin increase to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023 [AR Page 8]. The supply chain segment, despite its cessation, also showed a slight margin improvement (1.9% in FY2024 vs. 1.3% in FY2023) [AR Page 8]. The 1H2024 gross profit margin was 6.7% [Fuyu Pres H124 Page 6], lower than 1H2023's 9.0% due to a change in revenue mix, but 2H2024 saw a significant jump to 13.2% [Q424 E.8 Page 28].
    *   **EBITDA**: Consolidated EBITDA showed a remarkable turnaround, moving from a negative S$531k in FY2023 to a positive S$7,949k in FY2024. This was largely due to improved operating performance in the manufacturing segment and reduced operating expenses. EBITDA from continuing operations specifically saw a significant increase from S$0.6 million in FY2023 to S$8.5 million in FY2024 [AR Page 8].
    *   **Net Income**: The Group significantly narrowed its consolidated net loss by 61.5% from S$10.1 million in FY2023 to S$3.9 million in FY2024 [Q424 B(i) Page 4]. This improvement is primarily attributable to the manufacturing segment's improved performance and lower operating costs [Q424 E.8 Page 29]. The 1H2024 period even recorded a slight net profit of S$72k [Q424 E.11(iii) Page 23], before the impact of the discontinued operations and related impairments hit 2H2024.
3.  **Capital Expenditure (Capex)**:
    *   Capex increased substantially by 75.2% to S$6.9 million in FY2024 from S$4.0 million in FY2023 [AR Page 110]. This investment was "mainly for the purchase of factory equipment, plant and machineries" [AR Page 9], aligning with the strategic transformation and focus on high-precision manufacturing. The increase in Capex is a positive sign of investment in core capabilities.
4.  **Cash Flow Generation**:
    *   A significant turnaround in operating cash flow was observed, shifting from a net outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024 [AR Page 9, 110]. This was mainly driven by the reduction in loss before tax and a decrease in inventories and trade receivables [AR Page 9]. This indicates improved working capital management and operational efficiency, contributing to better liquidity.

#### Cash Flow Assessment:

The transition from a net operating cash outflow in FY2023 to a net inflow in FY2024 is a critical positive development, indicating improved operational efficiency and working capital management. Despite increased Capex, the Group managed to generate positive cash from operations. The overall cash and cash equivalents decreased from S$60.3 million to S$55.5 million in FY2024, largely due to investing activities (Capex) and repayment of loans [AR Page 9, 110]. The healthy net cash position of S$55.5 million at the end of FY2024 provides a strong liquidity buffer for ongoing operations and strategic investments [AR Page 9].

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends:

**2 Key Achievements:**

1.  **Significant Profitability Turnaround in Core Manufacturing Operations**: The Group's strategic pivot to focus on high-precision manufacturing has yielded tangible results. Revenue from continuing operations grew by 10.5%, outpacing the previous year. More impressively, EBITDA from continuing operations soared from S$0.6 million in FY2023 to S$8.5 million in FY2024, and the net loss from continuing operations narrowed sharply from S$7.6 million to S$1.2 million. This demonstrates the early successes of their strategy to focus on higher-margin product categories and operational efficiencies [AR Page 6, 8].
2.  **Strong Reversal in Operating Cash Flow Generation**: The Group successfully transitioned from a substantial net operating cash outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024 [AR Page 9, 110]. This achievement, driven by improved profitability and effective working capital management (decrease in inventories and trade receivables), significantly strengthens the Group's financial health and ability to fund its operations and strategic initiatives internally [AR Page 9].

**2 Key Challenges:**

1.  **Disruption and Financial Impact of Supply Chain Segment Cessation and Investigation**: The decision to cease the supply chain management services segment, while strategic, has led to significant financial impacts, including a S$3.3 million impairment of goodwill in FY2024 [AR Page 6]. More critically, the ongoing investigation into "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process" and "unverifiable arrangements" [AR Page 6, Q424 E.15 Page 25-26] poses a material risk to the Group's reputation and could lead to further financial repercussions, as highlighted by the auditor's qualified opinion [AR Page 104]. This event underscores systemic issues beyond just business performance, hinting at governance and internal control weaknesses [Learned Analytical Instruction 1].
2.  **Persistent Losses Despite Improvements & China Operations Weakness**: Despite the significant narrowing of losses, the Group still recorded a consolidated net loss of S$3.9 million in FY2024. The China operations within the manufacturing segment continue to be a drag, posting a higher loss before tax of S$4.3 million in FY2024 compared to S$3.8 million in FY2023, with declining revenue contribution [AR Page 9]. This indicates that while other segments are recovering, the China market remains a challenging area requiring focused attention or further strategic adjustments.

**2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**

1.  **Stated Reason for FYSCS Cessation vs. Underlying Issues**: Management's primary stated reason for ceasing FYSCS operations is "due to the inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" [Q424 E.15 Page 25]. However, the Chairman's Message and subsequent disclosures reveal an ongoing investigation into "weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process" and "unverifiable arrangements" [AR Page 6, Q424 E.15 Page 25-26]. The auditor's qualified opinion specifically due to the inability to determine the potential financial impact of "Claims which pertain to FYSCS" [AR Page 104] strongly suggests that the "inability to find a suitable candidate" is a downplayed narrative. The actual driver appears to be severe internal control deficiencies and potential misconduct, impacting the Group's overall financial integrity and requiring significant non-cash impairments [Learned Analytical Instruction 1].
2.  **Optimistic Outlook vs. 2H2024 Revenue Decline**: Management expressed optimism that "business momentum expected to grow in 2H2024" and "financial performance for FY2025 will improve compared to FY2024" [Q424 E.10 Page 30]. While FY2024 overall results improved, the 2H2024 consolidated revenue actually decreased by 45.8% compared to 2H2023 [Q424 E.11(iii) Page 23]. Although this is attributed to the cessation of the supply chain segment, the narrative of "growing business momentum" in 2H2024 seems to overlook this sharp consolidated revenue decline. The focus on the order book increase of the *continuing* manufacturing business may mask the immediate negative impact of the discontinued operations on the *consolidated* top line, creating a disconnect for investors looking at the overall group performance.
