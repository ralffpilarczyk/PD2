## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Group") operates as a high-end precision plastic and metal components and products manufacturer. The Group's operating footprint is strategically designed to provide vertically-integrated manufacturing services to a diverse international customer base. This analysis details the Group's physical and human resource distribution, its strategic alignment, significant changes, and how its operational structure supports its competitive positioning, focusing on non-financial data.

### 1. Operational Presence and Scale

Fu Yu is headquartered in Singapore and maintains a manufacturing presence across three countries: Singapore, Malaysia, and China. This multi-country presence supports its business model by offering geographical flexibility and a "one-stop solution" for customers' manufacturing needs, from product design and tooling fabrication to production, assembly, and testing.

*   **Total Manufacturing Sites:** 6 strategic manufacturing sites.
    *   **Singapore:** 1 (Headquarters and flagship Smart Factory at 8 Tuas Drive 1). This includes Fu Yu Biomedical Pte Ltd.
    *   **Malaysia:** 2 (Fu Hao Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd in Penang and Classic Advantage Sdn Bhd in Johor).
    *   **China:** 3 (Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Dongguan) Co., Ltd, Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd).
        *   Footnote: Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Shanghai) Co., Ltd was liquidated in FY2023. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.110, Note 5)
*   **Production Floor Capacity:** Over 1.5 million square feet (current as of FY2024).
    *   The Singapore Smart Factory at 9 Tuas Drive 1 specifically features over 9,348 square meters of usable space, optimized for workflow with Industry 4.0 machinery. It also includes a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.3, "Company Profile"; p.5, "Chairman's Message")
*   **Operating Assets and Ownership:**
    *   **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Carrying amount of S$58.603 million as of 31 December 2024.
    *   **Investment Property:** Carrying amount of S$5.842 million as of 31 December 2024, leased to third parties. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.108, "Statements of Financial Position"; p.114, Note 4)
    *   **Goodwill:** Fully impaired to S$0 million as of 31 December 2024 (from S$3.185 million in FY2023), due to the cessation of the supply chain management services segment. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.108, "Statements of Financial Position"; p.115, Note 6)
    *   The financial statements do not explicitly detail the ownership (owned vs. leased) for all specific manufacturing sites. However, leasehold properties are mentioned under PPE and Investment Property. The Group incurred S$2.449 million in additions to right-of-use assets (leased assets) in FY2024. (Fu Yu FS Q424, p.11, E Note 3)

### 2. Human Resources Distribution

The Group's workforce has seen a decline in overall numbers in FY2024 compared to previous years, alongside significant shifts in hiring and turnover dynamics.

*   **Total Employees (as of 31 December):**
    *   **FY2024:** 1,372 (1,241 permanent, 131 temporary). (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.48, "Employment")
    *   **FY2023:** 1,488. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.49, "Employment")
    *   **FY2022:** 1,535. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.49, "Employment")
    *   *Anomaly:* The FY2024 employee numbers explicitly exclude outsourced workers, unlike previous periods. This makes direct year-on-year comparisons for total employee numbers, new hire rates, and turnover rates less straightforward. Management states that year-on-year comparison will be done from FY2025 onwards on the new basis. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.49, Footnote 12 & 13)
*   **Employee Distribution by Region (FY2024):**
    *   Singapore: 484 employees
    *   Malaysia: 358 employees
    *   China: 530 employees
    *   (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.49, "Employment")
*   **New Hire Rate:**
    *   **FY2024:** 26.7% (366 new hires).
    *   **FY2023:** 60.7% (903 new hires).
    *   **FY2022:** 57.4% (883 new hires).
    *   (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.49, "Employment")
*   **Turnover Rate:**
    *   **FY2024:** 24.9% (342 employees left).
    *   **FY2023:** 60.7% (903 employees left).
    *   **FY2022:** 59.7% (918 employees left).
    *   *Insight:* The significant drop in both new hires and turnover rates in FY2024, despite the re-statement caveat, suggests a period of more stable, albeit reduced, workforce numbers. Management aims to maintain turnover (excluding temporary workers) below 30%. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.51, "Employment")
*   **Gender Distribution (FY2024):** Nearly 1:1 ratio (686 male, 686 female). (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.49, "Employment", p.21 "Highlights of Achievements")
*   **Age Distribution (FY2024):** Majority (61.4%) are 30-50 years old. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.56, "Diversity and Equal Opportunity")

### 4. Significant Changes and Trends in the Operating Footprint

The Group has undertaken several strategic shifts and investments in its operating footprint:

*   **Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):** In the last quarter of FY2024, the Group ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS). Management states this was "due to the inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" and to "reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business." (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5, "Chairman's Message"; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13, E Note 5 & 15).
    *   *Critical Stance:* This is a significant operational divestment. While management frames it as a strategic reallocation of resources to core manufacturing, the qualified audit opinion and ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs (including "significant weaknesses in FYSCS's risk management process" and "unverifiable arrangements") (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.104-105, "Independent Auditor's Report"; p.170, Note 32) suggest that the cessation may also be a response to material governance and financial issues within that segment. The full impairment of goodwill (S$3.286 million in FY2024) specifically related to FYSCS underscores the negative impact.
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing (Smart Factory & Automation):** Fu Yu has invested in its flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, equipping it with Industry 4.0 machinery, including capabilities for 3D metal printing and a 100K-class cleanroom. Capital expenditure notably increased to S$6.940 million in FY2024 (from S$3.962 million in FY2023), with a focus on factory equipment, plant, and machinery, particularly in Singapore. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.9, "Financial Position"; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.10, D)
    *   The Group is increasing automation levels in its toolroom to enable overnight and weekend production, aiming to reduce downtime by 40%. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, "Chairman's Message")
*   **Renewable Energy Integration:** Solar panels have been installed on Singapore facilities (completed FY2024), and installations are ongoing in Johor and Penang facilities (operational in Q4 FY2024 for Fu Hao, Q2 FY2025 for Classic Advantage). This initiative aims to generate up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5, "Chairman's Message"; p.47, "Renewable Energy")
    *   *Insight:* This directly supports the Group's sustainability goals, evident in the 2.5% reduction in purchased electricity consumption and overall 1.1% reduction in total GHG emissions (absolute terms) from FY2023 to FY2024. The reduction in water consumption (9.1% from FY2023) further highlights resource efficiency efforts.
*   **Digital Transformation:** Implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform, transitioning towards paperless mould-making and administrative processes (e.g., e-leave, e-banking). (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, "Chairman's Message"; p.46, "Paper Usage Reduction")
*   **Geographic Revenue Shift:** A deliberate shift away from reliance on China, with Singapore and Malaysia operations increasing their contribution to manufacturing revenue, offsetting the decline from China.
    *   Singapore's contribution grew from 36.8% (FY2023) to 40.2% (FY2024) of manufacturing sales.
    *   Malaysia's contribution grew from 28.2% (FY2023) to 31.9% (FY2024).
    *   China's contribution decreased from 35.0% (FY2023) to 27.9% (FY2024).
    *   (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5, "Chairman's Message"; p.9, "Operations Review")

### 5. Alignment with Business Strategy and Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu's operating structure is evolving to support its strategic objectives and strengthen its competitive positioning:

*   **Focus on High-Precision and Value-Add:** The investments in the Smart Factory, 3D metal printing, and cleanroom facilities affirm the Group's move up the value chain to higher-margin products in sectors like biomedical, medical devices, and drone technology. The NPI (New Product Introduction) team and advanced tooling capabilities are crucial enablers for securing these complex projects. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5, "Chairman's Message"; p.18, "Our Business")
*   **Geographical Diversification and Flexibility:** Operating in three countries allows Fu Yu to offer geographical flexibility to customers amidst geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain disruptions, especially as customers seek to diversify production away from China. This is a key competitive advantage. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, "Chairman's Message")
*   **Vertical Integration ("One-Stop Solution"):** The Group's comprehensive services from product design to assembly and testing, supported by its diverse manufacturing capabilities (plastic and metal injection moulding), aim to enhance customer experience and build long-term partnerships. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.3, "Company Profile"; p.18, "Our Business")
*   **Operational Efficiency and Sustainability:** The push for automation (ERP, toolroom automation) aims to improve productivity and reduce downtime. Simultaneously, investments in renewable energy and waste reduction initiatives demonstrate a commitment to sustainability, which is increasingly vital for customer attraction and regulatory compliance, and can also lead to cost savings (e.g., reduced electricity expenses). (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, "Chairman's Message"; p.38, "Energy Consumption")

**Overall Insight:**
The operating footprint analysis reveals a Group in transition. While the cessation of the FYSCS segment carries a significant governance and financial overhang, its strategic narrative is centered on shedding a non-core, problematic asset to intensify focus and resources on its high-precision manufacturing roots. The increased CAPEX and ongoing strategic initiatives (Smart Factory, automation, geographical diversification, sustainability) are critical steps to enhance its competitive edge and cater to evolving industry demands, particularly in high-growth, high-precision sectors. The decline in total employee count, though partly due to reclassification, aligns with automation efforts, but effective human capital development will be crucial as average training hours decreased in FY2024. The strong order book growth at year-end FY2024 indicates early positive traction from these operational adjustments and strategic redirection.
