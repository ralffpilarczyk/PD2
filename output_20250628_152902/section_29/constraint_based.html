## Section 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Over the last 24 months, Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance in its continuing manufacturing segment has shown a strong recovery and strategic pivot, driven by increased revenue, improved unit margins, and a renewed focus on operational efficiency. The Group successfully grew its manufacturing revenue, reflecting increased order volumes and new project wins, particularly in higher-value segments. Concurrently, it achieved notable improvements in its manufacturing gross profit margin, indicative of effective cost management and a strategic shift towards high-precision products. While energy intensity saw a temporary increase in FY2023, significant improvements in FY2024 demonstrate the Company's commitment to optimizing resource utilization and mitigating operational costs. These trends collectively underscore a positive trajectory for the core manufacturing business.

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue Growth

*   **Definition & Relevance:** Manufacturing revenue represents the total sales generated from the Group's core business activities: the manufacture and sub-assembly of precision plastic parts and components, and the fabrication of precision moulds and dies. It is a key indicator of market share, customer traction, and overall business volume, directly reflecting the Company's ability to secure and fulfill orders in its precision engineering segments. Growth in this metric demonstrates market acceptance and the effectiveness of sales strategies [1, p. 5].

*   **Historical Data & Trends (Last 24 Months):**
    *   1H 2023: S$52.6 million [3, p. 5, "Manufacturing Revenue by Geography" table].
    *   2H 2023: S$51.3 million [Calculated: S$103.9 million (FY2023 Manufacturing Revenue) [1, p. 5] - S$52.6 million (1H2023 Manufacturing Revenue) [3, p. 5]].
    *   1H 2024: S$54.8 million [3, p. 5, "Manufacturing Revenue by Geography" table].
    *   2H 2024: S$60.1 million [2, p. 4, B(i) "Condensed interim consolidated income statement", row "Revenue", column "2024 Six Months Ended 31 Dec"].
    The manufacturing revenue has shown a consistent upward trend over the last 24 months, growing from S$52.6 million in 1H 2023 to S$60.1 million in 2H 2024.

*   **Benchmarking:** While direct competitor data is not provided, the Group's manufacturing revenue grew by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [1, p. 5]. This growth occurred despite a "challenging operating environment" [2, p. 29, "Review of performance of the Group"], suggesting a strong relative performance against general market conditions. The Company's order book increased 20% year-on-year by the end of FY2024, indicating outperformance relative to its own previous periods [1, p. 6].

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The higher manufacturing revenue was primarily driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" [1, p. 5]. Geographically, Singapore operations improved 20.9% to S$46.2 million in FY2024, and Malaysia operations grew 24.9% to S$36.6 million in FY2024, largely due to higher demand for medical and consumer products [1, p. 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW"]. These project wins were enabled by "advanced tooling with high precision" and the introduction of a "New Product Introduction ('NPI') team" [1, p. 5].

*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend appears sustainable due to the "relatively 'sticky' nature of projects involving high-precision tooling" which are expected to "translate into long-term sustainable revenue" [1, p. 6]. The Company is actively building a strong pipeline by leveraging its Smart Factory's advanced capabilities and pursuing high-precision products, further supporting future growth [2, p. 30, "A commentary..."]. The 20% year-on-year increase in order book by end of FY2024 also supports continued growth into FY2025 [1, p. 6].

*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue contributed directly to the Group's overall revenue increase of 0.5% in FY2024, counteracting a decline in the supply chain management services segment [1, p. 8, "REVENUE"]. This revenue growth was a key factor in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations sharply to S$1.2 million in FY2024 from S$7.6 million in FY2023 [1, p. 8, "PROFITABILITY FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS"].

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What is the specific breakdown of new project wins in the biomedical and consumer segments by contract value and expected duration for FY2024, and what percentage of the increased order book at the end of FY2024 is attributable to these new segments versus increased volumes from existing non-biomedical/consumer customers?
    2.  Given the geographical shifts in revenue contribution (Singapore and Malaysia increasing, China decreasing), what specific strategies are in place to mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties and sourcing production away from China, and how will these strategies impact the overall cost structure and profitability of manufacturing operations in the next 12-24 months?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

*   **Definition & Relevance:** Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM) is the ratio of gross profit generated from the manufacturing segment to its total manufacturing revenue. It is a critical indicator of the Group's pricing power, cost efficiency in production, and the value added from its precision engineering services. A higher GPM indicates improved operational effectiveness and better unit economics [1, p. 5].

*   **Historical Data & Trends (Last 24 Months):**
    *   1H 2023: 11.85% [Calculated: (S$12,169k - S$5,934k Gross Profit Continuing Operations) / (S$103,941k - S$51,323k Manufacturing Revenue); 2, p. 4, B(i) "Condensed interim consolidated income statement"].
    *   2H 2023: 11.56% [Calculated: S$5,934k Gross Profit Continuing Operations / S$51,323k Manufacturing Revenue; 2, p. 4, B(i) "Condensed interim consolidated income statement"].
    *   1H 2024: 12.87% [Calculated: (S$15,516k - S$8,471k Gross Profit Continuing Operations) / (S$114,888k - S$60,138k Manufacturing Revenue); 2, p. 4, B(i) "Condensed interim consolidated income statement"].
    *   2H 2024: 14.08% [Calculated: S$8,471k Gross Profit Continuing Operations / S$60,138k Manufacturing Revenue; 2, p. 4, B(i) "Condensed interim consolidated income statement"].
    The manufacturing GPM has shown a positive trend, increasing from 11.85% in 1H 2023 to 14.08% in 2H 2024.

*   **Benchmarking:** The Group's manufacturing GPM improved to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023 [1, p. 5]. While direct competitor benchmarks are not provided, this represents a 1.8 percentage point improvement year-over-year, indicating enhanced internal efficiency and/or pricing strategies [1, p. 5].

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The improvement in GPM was largely "outpacing revenue growth" and was attributed to "early successes of our strategy to focus on what we do best â€“ high-precision manufacturing" [1, p. 5]. The shift towards higher-margin product categories through new product introduction (NPI) and advanced tooling capabilities has been a key driver [1, p. 5]. This includes securing new projects across a broad spectrum of industries, including medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances, which reflect a focus on innovative, high-performance products [1, p. 5].

*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The upward trend in GPM appears sustainable, driven by the strategic shift to higher-value, high-precision projects which are inherently "sticky" and provide long-term revenue [1, p. 6]. Ongoing investments in the Smart Factory, including Industry 4.0 machinery and a 100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products, further support this move up the value chain [1, p. 5]. The Group is also stabilizing high-precision products at the 5-micron precision level and aims to move up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision, ensuring continued premium positioning [1, p. 6].

*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The increase in manufacturing GPM from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024 directly contributed to a 28.1% increase in manufacturing gross profit, from S$12.1 million to S$15.5 million [1, p. 8, "GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN"]. This gross profit expansion was a significant factor in the overall narrowing of the Group's net loss from continuing operations to S$1.2 million in FY2024 from S$7.6 million in FY2023 [1, p. 8, "PROFITABILITY FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS"].

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What specific internal initiatives (e.g., process optimization, automation, raw material sourcing changes) contributed most significantly to the 2.52 percentage point increase in manufacturing GPM from 1H2023 to 1H2024, and how are these initiatives being scaled across all manufacturing sites?
    2.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of the gross profit margin by product category (e.g., medical, consumer, automotive, industrial) for the last 24 months, and what is the anticipated mix of these high-margin versus lower-margin projects for FY2025?

### 3. Energy Intensity

*   **Definition & Relevance:** Energy intensity measures the amount of energy consumed (in Gigajoules, GJ) per S$ million of revenue in the manufacturing segment. It serves as a key indicator of operational efficiency, particularly in managing energy costs, which are a significant component of manufacturing expenses. Lower energy intensity reflects better asset utilization and cost control within the production process [1, p. 39].

*   **Historical Data & Trends (Last 24 Months):**
    *   FY2022: 809.17 GJ/S$ million [Calculated: 121,374.0 GJ (Total Energy Consumed FY2022) [1, p. 39, "Energy Consumption (GJ) table"] / S$149.997 million (FY2022 Manufacturing Revenue) [2, p. 14, "Reportable Segments" table]].
    *   FY2023: 1121.09 GJ/S$ million [Calculated: 116,481.6 GJ (Total Energy Consumed FY2023) [1, p. 39, "Energy Consumption (GJ) table"] / S$103.9 million (FY2023 Manufacturing Revenue) [1, p. 39, "Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue) table"]].
    *   FY2024: 1044.0 GJ/S$ million [1, p. 39, "Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue) table"].
    The energy intensity increased significantly from FY2022 to FY2023, then saw an improvement in FY2024, though remaining higher than FY2022 levels.

*   **Benchmarking:** No external benchmarking data is provided. However, the Group's overall energy consumption (excluding petrol and diesel) saw a slight increase of 1.0% in FY2024, while manufacturing revenue grew by 10.5% in FY2024 [1, p. 39, p. 5]. The decrease in energy intensity from 1121.09 GJ/S$ million in FY2023 to 1044.0 GJ/S$ million in FY2024 represents a 6.9% improvement in energy efficiency relative to revenue generated [Calculated].

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The spike in energy intensity from FY2022 to FY2023 (809.17 to 1121.09 GJ/S$ million) is primarily due to a substantial decrease in manufacturing revenue from S$150.0 million in FY2022 to S$103.9 million in FY2023, while total energy consumed decreased less proportionally (from 121,374.0 GJ to 116,481.6 GJ) [1, p. 39, "Energy Consumption (GJ) table"; 2, p. 14, "Reportable Segments" table]. The subsequent improvement in FY2024 (down to 1044.0 GJ/S$ million) despite a 1.0% overall energy consumption increase was driven by a larger 10.5% increase in manufacturing revenue [1, p. 39, p. 5]. Specific initiatives contributing to efficiency gains include "investment in energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines" and "upgrade existing lighting with more efficient LED lighting" [1, p. 39].

*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend of improving energy intensity is likely sustainable, as the Group has "invested in energy-efficient electric machines" and plans to "increase automation levels of our toolroom such that production can continue overnight and even on weekends. This can reduce downtime by 40% compared to a typical facility" [1, p. 39, p. 6]. The installation of solar panels in Singapore (completed FY2024) and planned expansion in Malaysia (operational Q4 FY2024/Q2 FY2025) aim to mitigate rising energy costs and further enhance efficiency, generating up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy [1, p. 5, p. 37, "Renewable Energy"]. The Group explicitly states a "medium-term target to reduce the Scope 2 overall emissions by 30% by FY2030, using FY2023 as the baseline," which implies a continued focus on improving energy efficiency [1, p. 41].

*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The reduction in energy intensity from 1121.09 GJ/S$ million in FY2023 to 1044.0 GJ/S$ million in FY2024 helped to manage operational costs despite rising energy prices [1, p. 31, "Increasing energy prices"]. While precise cost savings are not isolated, the Company states that reducing energy consumption unlocks "significant cost savings for our business" [1, p. 39]. This aligns with the overall reduction in "selling and administrative expenses" by 20.4% in FY2024 (partially due to lower electricity charges) and contributed to the narrowed net loss [1, p. 8, "SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS"].

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What specific capital expenditure has been allocated for energy-efficient machinery upgrades and solar panel installations in FY2025, and what is the projected impact of these investments on energy consumption and associated costs for the manufacturing segment?
    2.  How does the Group track the Return on Investment (ROI) of its energy efficiency initiatives, and can it provide a breakdown of actual cost savings achieved from these initiatives in FY2024 compared to previous periods?
