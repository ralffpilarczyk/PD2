    <h2>SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis</h2>

    <p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Group") operates as a high-end precision plastic and metal components manufacturer, strategically positioning its physical and human resources across Singapore, Malaysia, and China to support a vertically-integrated business model. The Group emphasizes a "one-stop solution" approach for its manufacturing services, covering product design, tooling, production, assembly, and testing. Recent strategic transformations, including investments in advanced manufacturing and a re-evaluation of its business segments, are significantly reshaping its operational footprint to enhance competitive positioning and align with evolving market dynamics.</p>

    <h3>a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu's workforce is primarily composed of permanent, full-time employees, supplemented by temporary staff to meet dynamic operational needs. As of December 31, 2024, the Group's total workforce was 1,372 employees. This represents a reduction of approximately 10.6% from FY2022 (1,535 employees) and 7.8% from FY2023 (1,488 employees). While the total workforce decreased, the impact of the cessation of the supply chain management services segment, which was a significant operational activity, on specific headcount is not explicitly detailed, suggesting either this segment was not labor-intensive or other factors contributed to the overall reduction.</p>

    <h4>Employee Headcount by Region (FY2024)</h4>

    <p>The Group's total workforce decreased from 1,535 in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024, a reduction of approximately 10.6% over two years. This reduction is notable, especially considering the cessation of the supply chain management services segment, indicating either a lean operational model for that segment or a broader drive for efficiency across the Group. The near 1:1 male-to-female ratio across the entire workforce (50.0% male, 50.0% female) highlights the Group's commitment to gender equality in employment.</p>

    <p>Employee turnover rates for FY2024 were 24.9% overall (342 employees). Separately, turnover rates for new hires were 11.5% for males and 15.2% for females. While the Group aims to maintain a turnover rate (exclusive of temporary workers) below 30% moving forward, a 24.9% rate is relatively high for a precision manufacturing environment, which could impact operational consistency, quality control, and training costs. This raises questions about the Group's talent retention strategies and the underlying causes of employee departures, particularly given the stated ambition to maintain a skilled and efficient workforce.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu's geographical footprint, spanning Singapore, Malaysia, and China, is a cornerstone of its business strategy, particularly in a global environment characterized by supply chain disruptions and geopolitical shifts. The distribution of manufacturing sites across these three countries allows the Group to offer "geographical flexibility" to its customers, a critical advantage as more clients seek to diversify production away from China. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singapore: High-Value & Advanced Manufacturing Hub</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Singapore Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1) serves as the Group's hub for advanced precision engineering. Its capabilities in complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and a 100K-class cleanroom are essential for high-margin sectors like biomedical and life sciences. The launch of Fu Yu Biomedical in 2023, operating from the same Singapore HQ, reinforces this strategic pivot towards high-precision medical technology and biotechnology. This focus on high-value, high-precision manufacturing aligns with Singapore's role as a technological and innovation center. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, "COMPANY PROFILE" section; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small></li>
                <li>Singapore operations have gained significant share in manufacturing sales, indicating successful execution of this strategy. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section)</small></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Malaysia: Growing Regional Manufacturing Base</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Malaysia's operations (Penang and Johor) are expanding their contribution, driven by higher demand for medical and consumer products. This growth signifies Malaysia's importance as a robust and expanding manufacturing base complementing Singapore's high-end focus. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section)</small></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>China: Diversified Local Market Focus</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite a decline in contribution, China's facilities remain critical for serving the local "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" markets. This strategy mitigates risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade shifts, ensuring continued presence and market access in a large economy. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section; Fuyu Pres H124, Page 14, "Conclusion & Outlook", "Industry Outlook")</small></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The diversified geographic footprint directly supports Fu Yu's competitive positioning as a "trusted manufacturing partner for innovative, high-performance products" by providing resilience against regional disruptions and offering flexible production solutions to international customers seeking to de-risk their supply chains.</p>

    <h3>d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu has undergone several significant changes and embraced key trends in its operating footprint, primarily driven by strategic transformation and external market factors.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> The Group ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") in the last quarter of FY2024. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 11, "E Selected notes to the condensed interim financial statements", Note 1 "Corporate Information")</small></li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This strategic decision allows Fu Yu to reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business, sharpening its focus on high-precision manufacturing. The cessation of this segment, which was a significant operational activity for the Group, represents a substantial streamlining of the operating model. The company initiated investigations into FYSCS's affairs, which highlighted significant weaknesses in its risk management process. This raises critical questions about corporate governance and internal controls within the Group, and what corrective measures have been implemented Group-wide to prevent similar issues. While specific financial impacts are not detailed in the provided non-financial data, this move suggests a prioritization of de-risking and focusing on core competencies. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section)</small></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Geographic Manufacturing Contribution Shift:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> The manufacturing contribution by location has evolved over the past two years. Singapore and Malaysia operations have gained significant share in total manufacturing output, while China's contribution has decreased. Historical data for these contributions over multiple years and interim periods is not provided in a consistent non-financial format, but the trend indicates a rebalancing of the manufacturing footprint.

        <li><strong>Pace of Investment:</strong> While significant changes are underway, the scale of investment, particularly the stated focus on achieving "Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities" and achieving high levels of automation across multiple sites, appears ambitious given the absence of explicitly large capital expenditure figures in non-financial data, suggesting a phased implementation or highly targeted investments. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 9, "FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS", "FINANCIAL POSITION" section; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 24, "14. Operating Segments", "Capital expenditure**" row)</small></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4. Renewable Energy Integration:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Solar panels were installed on Singapore facilities in FY2024. Panels in Johor became operational in Q4 FY2024, and Penang facilities are expected to be operational by Q2 FY2025. These installations allow the Group to generate up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy. Historical data for energy consumption before FY2024 and interim data for renewable energy generation are not consistently provided. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Page 37, "Renewable energy integration"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives", "Renewable Energy" section)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This initiative aims to power on-site operations, reduce carbon emissions, and mitigate the impact of rising energy costs. Total energy consumption (excluding petrol and diesel) increased slightly by 1.0% in FY2024, reporting 4,001.8 GJ, which includes their self-generated solar energy. This implies that while overall energy usage slightly increased, the proportion of clean energy used for operations has significantly grown, potentially leading to a substantial decrease in energy drawn from external grids and reduced operational environmental footprint. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 37, "Energy Consumption" section)</small></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5. Operational Efficiency Improvements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> The decline in non-hazardous waste is noted, which the Group attributes to improved production efficiency. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 47, "Our Initiatives", "Waste Management")</small></li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> While waste reduction can be driven by various factors like new machinery, optimized processes, or changes in material inputs, improved production efficiency suggests more streamlined operations. This, combined with the focus on advanced manufacturing, potentially contributes to the reduction in total employee numbers while maintaining or improving output, indicating higher productivity per employee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu's operating structure is intricately designed to support and enhance its competitive positioning as a leading manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Vertically-Integrated Manufacturing Services:</strong> The Group's ability to offer a "one-stop solution" for its manufacturing services (product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing) creates significant value-add for customers. This end-to-end capability streamlines the manufacturing process, reduces lead times, and ensures quality control across all stages, fostering long-term partnerships with a diverse and loyal customer base. The introduction of the New Product Introduction ("NPI") team further strengthens this by adding value in the early stages of the business cycle, particularly for higher-margin product categories. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, "COMPANY PROFILE" section; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Advanced Technology and High-Precision Capabilities:</strong> The flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, equipped with Industry 4.0 machinery, 3D metal printing, and a 100K-class cleanroom, positions Fu Yu at the forefront of precision manufacturing in Asia. Its capability to produce complex mould inserts and achieve 5-micron precision (with a target for even higher levels) allows the Group to secure new projects in demanding sectors like medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances, where precision and quality are paramount. This technological edge supports its reputation for innovative, high-performance products and enables entry into higher-value market segments. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, "COMPANY PROFILE" section; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Geographical Flexibility:</strong> Operating across Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides a critical competitive advantage, especially in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty. As more customers seek to diversify their supply chains away from China, Fu Yu's multi-country production footprint offers the agility and resilience needed to mitigate risks and cater to evolving sourcing preferences. This allows them to maintain a diversified customer base and adapt to global supply chain shifts, as evidenced by the recent rebalancing of manufacturing contribution across regions. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
        </li>
