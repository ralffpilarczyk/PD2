ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
-   **Synthesize granular data into evidence-based conclusions:** Prioritize the extraction of clear, actionable conclusions from detailed data, ensuring each insight directly supports or elaborates on broader findings.
-   **Employ systematic decomposition for comprehensive coverage:** Utilize structured analytical approaches, such as segmenting data by category, time, or key dimension, to ensure all relevant aspects are explored and granular insights are uncovered.
-   **Explicitly map data to higher-level implications:** Focus on identifying and articulating the direct relationships between detailed data points and the overarching conclusions or recommendations, thereby demonstrating the analytical foundation.
-   **Leverage comparative analysis to reveal significance:** Systematically compare different data sets (e.g., across time periods, groups, or scenarios) to highlight significant deviations, trends, or consistencies that provide deeper meaning.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
-   **Proactively establish foundational completeness:** In the initial draft, include all necessary contextual information, such as data sources, methodologies, assumptions, and limitations, to prevent subsequent rework for fundamental gaps.
-   **Progress beyond description to explanation and interpretation:** Ensure the analysis moves beyond merely stating "what happened" to explaining "why it happened" and, where appropriate, interpreting its implications or potential future impact.
-   **Conduct an early, comprehensive content mapping:** Before drafting, create a detailed outline or content checklist for the entire document, especially for extensive sections, to identify and plan for all required data points and analytical narratives.
-   **Implement a 'reader's perspective' review early in the process:** During the first attempt, review the draft from the perspective of the intended audience to identify potential areas of confusion, missing context, or unaddressed questions.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
-   **Design for modularity and efficient navigation:** Structure appendix sections with clear, hierarchical headings, consistent labeling, and internal cross-references to allow readers to easily access specific details without navigating the entire document.
-   **Clearly articulate the purpose and relevance of each section:** For every major appendix component, provide a concise introduction explaining its content, its relevance to the main report, and any specific methodologies or caveats.
-   **Systematically cross-reference appendix content within the main document:** Ensure that every relevant point in the main report directs the reader to the specific, detailed supporting information in the appendix, creating a seamless reference flow.
-   **Prioritize exhaustive detail for transparency and reproducibility:** Provide the full granular data, detailed calculation steps, and comprehensive methodological explanations required for independent verification or replication of the analysis.
-   **Focus analytical depth on validation and robustness checks:** Include detailed sensitivity analyses, alternative scenarios, and robustness checks in the appendix to proactively address potential skepticism and bolster confidence in the primary findings.
