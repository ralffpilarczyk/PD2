*   **Operational Investments:** Ongoing transition to electric machinery and Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g., Smart Factory) should further enhance efficiency and margins [^12].
*   **Caveat:** The slight GPM dip in 2H 2024 (14.08% vs. 15.51% in 1H 2024) warrants further investigation.

**Quantify Financial Impact:**
The 1.8 ppt GPM increase (11.7% FY2023 to 13.5% FY2024) translated into a S$3.4 million (28.1%) increase in manufacturing gross profit (S$12.1M to S$15.5M) [^4]. This significantly contributed to narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million (FY2023) to S$1.2 million (FY2024) [^13].

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What specific initiatives and pricing strategies led to the 3.34 ppt GPM increase (2H 2023 to 1H 2024) and the subsequent 1.43 ppt decrease (1H 2024 to 2H 2024)?
2.  Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing GPM by product category (e.g., life sciences, medical, consumer) or new vs. existing projects to assess margin quality and sustainability?
3.  Given the absence of public data, can the Company provide proprietary benchmarking data (e.g., average industry GPM for similar precision engineering firms) to assess its competitive position?
