## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

Fu Yu Corporation, a manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components, strategically distributes its resources across Asia.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions

Fu Yu's total employee headcount declined from 1,535 in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024. A significant concern is the persistently high turnover rate, which, even after a restatement for GRI alignment, remained 24.9% in FY2024 (down from 63.8% in FY2023). Crucially, FY2024 headcount excludes outsourced workers (unlike prior years), severely impacting direct comparability and obscuring actual organic headcount trends. This lack of consistent data fundamentally undermines operational stability and sustainability assessment. Regionally, Singapore's workforce increased to 484 in FY2024 (from 429 in FY2023) while China's significantly reduced (from 694 to 530), aligning with the Group's pivot away from China. Singapore's higher new hire rate (44.4%) compared to China (9.1%) further underscores this shift towards its Smart Factory and biomedical segment. The persistently high turnover suggests underlying issues with compensation, working conditions, or morale, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and increased training costs. Absence of functional employee distribution also limits insight into strategic resource allocation effectiveness.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance, and Ownership

Fu Yu operates over 1.5 million sqft of production capacity. The Singapore Smart Factory, with approximately 100,621 sqft usable space, is central to its asset strategy, supporting high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products. This facility aims for 5-micron precision, utilizing Industry 4.0 machinery and an integrated cloud-based IT platform. However, the Smart Factory's ~6.7% share of total capacity raises questions about its *actual* impact on overall revenue and margins, and how such a small fraction can genuinely drive a company-wide shift to high-end manufacturing without broader upgrades or stated utilization/revenue contributions. A significant increase in Additions to Right-of-Use (ROU) assets (leased) from S$438,000 in FY2022 to S$2,449,000 in FY2024 indicates a growing reliance on leased assets. While this preserves capital, it demands clarity on the rationale and its long-term impact on financial flexibility and fixed obligations.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

The Group operates 6 manufacturing sites across Singapore (2), Malaysia (2), and China (3), alongside its Singapore headquarters. This multi-country footprint aligns with the strategy to offer "geographical flexibility" in response to "geopolitical uncertainty" and "customers seeking to source production away from China," with a greater contribution from Singapore and Malaysia, and Chinese facilities now focusing on "China-for-China and China-for-Asia" strategies. However, this narrative is directly contradicted by a "significant impairment loss on property, plant and equipment in a China subsidiary (S$579,000 in FY2024)." An impairment loss signals underutilization, obsolescence, or declining expected future cash flows. This implies underutilization or a less robust local market strategy, warranting deeper investigation into Chinese operations' financial health and utilization.

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

**The abrupt cessation of the Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) segment in Q4 FY2024 is the most significant and concerning change.** While management presents this as a "reallocation of resources," it is underscored by severe red flags including an "ongoing investigation into FYSCSâ€™s past affairs," "significant weaknesses in risk management," "potential misuse of resources," and an "arbitral ruling" against FYSCS. Crucially, FYSCS was described as a "significant contributor to the Group's revenue in FY2024" before its cessation. Furthermore, all newly acquired "key customer relationships" shifting from one customer in FY2023 to three in FY2024 came *entirely* from the now-discontinued FYSCS segment. This implies a massive, unquantified hole in future revenue and customer base, signaling profound governance risks and raising questions about the integrity of past operational contributions and the actual stability of these customer relationships post-cessation. Investors require full transparency on the specific financial impact (past and future), remaining liabilities from the investigation and arbitration, and a clear strategy for replacing the lost revenue and customer relationships. Other key strategic shifts include continued investment in the Singapore Smart Factory for high-precision manufacturing, significant renewable energy integration (up to 3,233 MWh total capacity across facilities), increased automation (e.g., toolroom, electric machinery, 3D printing), digital transformation (e.g., paperless mould-making), and workforce optimization with a regional shift towards Singapore.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu's operating structure aims to support its competitive positioning as a "one-stop solution" provider through advanced capabilities at the Singapore Smart Factory (high-precision tooling, cleanroom); geographic diversification for "flexibility" from geopolitical tensions; value-added services from design to assembly; sustainability integration (solar power, waste reduction); and operational efficiency via automation and digitalization. These initiatives enhance customer stickiness, reputation, and productivity. However, this competitive positioning is severely challenged. The S$579,000 impairment loss on China PPE in FY2024 indicates asset underutilization, contradicting efficient geographic diversification. More critically, the reliance on the now-discontinued FYSCS segment for *all* new "key customer relationships" in FY2024, despite its severe governance issues ("significant weaknesses," "ongoing investigation"), casts a substantial shadow. This exposes the Group's past reliance on a problematic unit for customer growth, undermining the perceived stability of its customer base and the robustness of its "one-stop solution" offering. Serious concerns remain about the long-term sustainability of client relationships and revenue, demanding clarity on client transition or loss.
