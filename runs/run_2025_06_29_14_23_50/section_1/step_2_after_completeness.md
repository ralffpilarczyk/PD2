## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or "the Group") is Singapore's oldest and one of Asia's largest manufacturers of high-end precision plastic and metal components and products. Established in 1978 and listed on the Singapore Exchange since 1995, the Group provides vertically-integrated manufacturing services to a diverse international customer base across life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, and industrial sectors. Its operating footprint is strategically distributed across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, enabling it to offer a comprehensive one-stop solution from product design to assembly and testing.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions

Fu Yu's workforce is primarily composed of permanent, full-time employees, supplemented by temporary staff to meet operational demands. The Group's total headcount has shown a consistent decline over the past three fiscal years, from 1,535 in FY2022 to 1,488 in FY2023, and further to 1,372 employees as of December 31, 2024. The most recent data indicates a near 1:1 male to female employee ratio group-wide (686 male, 686 female).

**Employee Distribution by Region and Type (FY2024)**

| Region    | Total Employees (FY2024) | Permanent Employees (FY2024) | Temporary/Contract Employees (FY2024) | Source                                |
| :-------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| Singapore | 484                      | 484                          | 0                                     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 49, "Employment"      |
| Malaysia  | 358                      | 358                          | 0                                     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 49, "Employment"      |
| China     | 530                      | 400                          | 130                                   | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 49, "Employment"      |
| **Total** | **1,372**                | **1,241**                    | **131**                               | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 49, "Employment"      |

*Note: Employee numbers for FY2022 and FY2023 are total employees (including outsourced workers in prior periods), while FY2024 data explicitly excludes outsourced workers for GRI alignment. Detailed employee distribution by region for FY2022 and FY2023, and for interim periods, is not explicitly provided in the available annual report or interim financial statements. Furthermore, the annual report does not disaggregate employee numbers by specific functional areas (e.g., manufacturing, R&D, sales, administration, management).*

The new hire rate for FY2024 was 26.7%, with 366 new employees integrated. The turnover rate for the same period was 24.9% (342 employees leaving). The Group aims to maintain a turnover rate (exclusive of temporary workers) below 30%. The higher number of temporary employees in China (130 of 530 total in the region) suggests operational flexibility in response to fluctuating business activities in that market. While management aims for a "secure and positive work environment" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 52), the decrease in average training hours per employee from 16 hours in FY2023 to 13.2 hours in FY2024 due to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 56) could pose a non-financial risk (Learned Analytical Instruction 1) to employee skill development and long-term talent retention, particularly in a precision engineering industry reliant on skilled labor. This might impact the ability to adapt to new technologies or maintain high precision levels, especially given the declining overall headcount.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance, and Their Ownership

Fu Yu operates six strategic manufacturing sites across three countries and boasts over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 2, "Company Profile").

**Key Operating Assets:**
*   **Singapore Facilities:** Headquarters (8 Tuas Drive 1), Fu Yu Biomedical Pte Ltd (8 Tuas Drive 1). The flagship Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1) is highlighted as one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 2, "Company Profile"). This facility features a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products, capabilities for complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing. It has over 9,348 sqm of usable space optimized for workflow with Industry 4.0 machinery (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6, "Chairman's Message").
*   **Malaysia Facilities:** Fu Hao Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd (Penang) and Classic Advantage Sdn Bhd (Johor) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 14, "Our Network").
*   **China Facilities:** Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Dongguan) Co., Ltd, Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, and Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 14, "Our Network").

**Ownership:**
The Group's property, plant and equipment (PPE) amounted to S$58.603 million as of December 31, 2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 108, "Statements of Financial Position"). While specific ownership details (owned vs. leased) for each named facility are not explicitly broken down in the annual report, the financial statements indicate significant "leasehold properties" within PPE (S$41.764 million as of Dec 31, 2024) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 111, "Property, plant and equipment"). The Group also has "right-of-use assets" related to leased properties presented as part of PPE, with new additions of S$2.449 million in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 111, "Property, plant and equipment" & p. 138, "Leases"). This suggests a substantial portion of the Group's operational footprint is under lease arrangements rather than outright ownership. An investment property in Johor, Malaysia, is leased to third parties and is valued at approximately S$7.158 million as of December 31, 2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 113, "Investment property").

*Note: Historical data for total production floor capacity or specific facility square footage for the last three years and five most recent interim periods is not provided in the available annual report or interim financial statements.*

The strategic importance of these assets lies in their specialized capabilities (e.g., cleanroom, 3D printing for rapid prototyping) and geographic distribution, which supports the Group's one-stop solution model and offers "geographical flexibility" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6, "Chairman's Message"). The investment in energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic ones and the upgrading of lighting to LED are operational changes aimed at reducing energy consumption (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 37, "Energy Consumption").

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

Fu Yu's geographic footprint spans Singapore, Malaysia, and China, with the headquarters in Singapore. This multi-country presence is a core part of its business strategy, allowing the Group to serve a diverse international customer base and offer "geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6, "Chairman's Message").

**Geographic Contribution to Manufacturing Revenue (as % of total manufacturing revenue)**

| Period     | Singapore (%) | Malaysia (%) | China (%) | Source                               |
| :--------- | :------------ | :----------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------- |
| FY2024     | 40.2          | 31.9         | 27.9      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 8, "Business Segment Review" |
| FY2023     | 36.8          | 28.2         | 35.0      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 8, "Business Segment Review" |
| FY2022     | 35.0          | 24.0         | 41.0      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 8, "Business Segment Review" |

| 1H2023     | 35.3          | 24.3         | 40.5      | Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p. 5            |

*Note: The available interim reports provide half-yearly breakdowns, resulting in four distinct interim periods for analysis.*

The strategic alignment is evident in the clear shift of revenue contribution over the past three years: Singapore and Malaysia operations have seen increased contributions to manufacturing sales, while China's contribution has declined from 41.0% in FY2022 to 27.9% in FY2024. This aligns with the stated strategy of customers seeking to source production away from China amid geopolitical uncertainty (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6, "Chairman's Message"). The Group's focus on "China-for-China and China-for-Asia strategies" in its China facilities (Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p. 13) is a direct response to external market trends (Learned Analytical Instruction 2), aiming to mitigate the impact of the broader shift away from China.

*Note: The number of customers is not explicitly disclosed in the available annual report or interim financial statements for any period.*

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

A significant change in FY2024 was the **cessation of all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS)** in the last quarter of the year (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6, "Chairman's Message"). This was a strategic decision to "reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). This cessation, however, is accompanied by an **ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs**, which highlighted "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). The auditor has issued a qualified opinion on the financial statements due to the inability to determine the potential financial impact of this ongoing investigation (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 104). This presents a significant non-financial risk (Learned Analytical Instruction 1) in terms of reputational damage, potential loss of key personnel involved, and a distraction for management, even if isolated to a discontinued segment. The Group also intends to make claims against certain persons related to the acquisition and alleged misuse of FYSCS's resources (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 172), indicating potential for prolonged legal and financial implications.

Other significant trends and changes include:
*   **Geographic Shift in Manufacturing Focus:** As detailed in section (c), a clear trend of increasing manufacturing revenue contribution from Singapore and Malaysia, offsetting a decline from China, is observed across all periods. This indicates a successful strategic pivot in response to market dynamics and geopolitical shifts.
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing:** Continued investment in the Singapore Smart Factory, including capabilities for 3D metal printing and a 100K-class cleanroom, positions the Group for higher-margin biomedical and advanced technology projects (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). This is a strategic move to capture value in specialized segments.
*   **Automation and Digitalization:** Completion of testing for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform in FY2024 aims to increase automation levels in the toolroom, potentially reducing downtime by 40% (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 7). This operational efficiency drive, while aiming for cost reduction, also carries non-financial risks related to employee morale and adaptation to new systems (Learned Analytical Instruction 1), especially given the overall decline in headcount.
*   **Sustainability Integration:** Installation of solar panels on facilities in Singapore (completed FY2024), Johor (operational 4QFY2024), and Penang (expected 2QFY2025) signifies a trend towards renewable energy and a "greener, more responsible footprint" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 2, 6, 47). This proactive measure not only aligns with ESG goals but also helps mitigate risks from rising energy prices (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 31, "TCFD table").
*   **Waste Reduction Initiatives:** Significant reduction in hazardous waste (25.7% decrease in FY2024 from FY2023), shift to reusable containers in Singapore (saving >300 tonnes of paper annually), and adoption of paperless systems (MES, e-leave) reflect a strong operational trend towards environmental responsibility (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 45-46).
*   **Precision Level Advancement:** The Group is stabilizing high-precision products at the 5-micron level and aims to move to even higher levels of precision (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 7). This is an operational capability enhancement critical for maintaining competitiveness in high-end manufacturing.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu's operating structure directly supports its competitive positioning as a high-end precision manufacturer through several key aspects:
*   **Vertically-Integrated One-Stop Solution:** By offering product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing services, the Group provides comprehensive solutions that enhance value for customers and foster long-term partnerships (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 2). This "sticky" nature of projects involving high-precision tooling (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 7) creates a competitive moat, making it difficult for customers to switch suppliers.
*   **Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities:** The Singapore Smart Factory, with its 100K-class cleanroom, 3D metal printing, and Industry 4.0 machinery, enables the Group to target and secure projects in high-growth, high-margin sectors like biomedical and medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). This advanced capability allows them to manufacture complex and high-precision components that many competitors cannot, differentiating them in the market.
*   **Geographical Flexibility and De-risking:** Operating manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China allows Fu Yu to offer customers supply chain resilience and flexibility, particularly appealing to those seeking to diversify production away from China due to geopolitical tensions (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). This multi-country footprint is a significant competitive advantage in the current global climate, allowing the Group to adapt to shifting customer demands and geopolitical landscapes.
*   **Focus on High-Precision and NPI:** The strategic transformation to focus on high-precision manufacturing and the introduction of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5) allows the Group to add value in the early stages of the business cycle, attracting customers in higher-margin product categories and fostering innovation.
*   **Sustainability as a Differentiator:** Investments in renewable energy (solar panels) and the exploration of eco-friendly materials like bio-resins (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 47) align with growing customer preferences for sustainable products and practices. This not only reduces operational costs but also enhances the Group's reputation and appeal to environmentally conscious clients, potentially securing new business opportunities.

Overall, Fu Yu's operating footprint, characterized by strategic geographic distribution, advanced technological capabilities, and a commitment to vertical integration and sustainability, is designed to support its competitive positioning as a leading high-precision manufacturer capable of meeting evolving customer demands and navigating geopolitical shifts. The identified trends, such as the shift away from China and investment in automation, demonstrate the Group's proactive adaptation to market forces, despite the challenges highlighted by the declining headcount and the FYSCS investigation.
