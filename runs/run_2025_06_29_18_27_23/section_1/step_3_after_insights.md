## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

Maxis Berhad (Maxis) operates a comprehensive footprint primarily concentrated within Malaysia, strategically designed to support its ambition as a leading integrated telecommunications provider. While the company's physical and human resources are distributed to maximize network coverage, enhance customer experience, and drive digital transformation across its core Mobile, Home, and Enterprise segments, a deeper analytical review reveals areas warranting critical scrutiny regarding resource allocation and long-term sustainability.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions

Maxis' human capital is a critical component of its operating footprint, with a stated focus on skill development and well-being, yet recent trends raise questions about long-term capacity.

**Employee Headcount & Demographics:**
*   **Total Employees:**
    *   **2022:** 4,078 employees [AR 2024, p.42]
    *   **2023:** 3,803 employees [AR 2024, p.42]
    *   **2024:** 3,288 employees [AR 2024, p.42]. This represents a significant 19.4% reduction in workforce over the last three years, indicating ongoing "staff and resource cost optimisation exercise" [AR 2024, p.135, Note 7]. This manpower rationalization contributed to a reduction in staff costs from RM880 million in 2023 to RM839 million in 2024 [AR 2024, p.134, Note 7; 24Q4 TS, p.18].
*   **Gender Distribution (Permanent & Contract Employees):**
    *   **2022:** 43% Female, 55% Male (Permanent); 1% Female, 1% Male (Contract) [AR 2024, p.45]
    *   **2023:** 42% Female, 56% Male (Permanent); 1% Female, 1% Male (Contract) [AR 2024, p.45]
    *   **2024:** 41% Female, 57% Male (Permanent); 1% Female, 1% Male (Contract) [AR 2024, p.45]. The proportion of female employees has slightly decreased.
*   **Employee Category (Gender Breakdown):** A consistent male dominance is observed in senior and managerial roles, with female representation decreasing slightly in Individual Contributor roles (44.7% in 2022 to 43.2% in 2024). [AR 2024, p.45]
*   **Age Group:** The majority of employees (over 70%) fall within the 30-49 age bracket across all categories. [AR 2024, p.45]
*   **Employees with Disability:** Maxis maintains a low percentage of employees with disabilities (0.11% in 2024), continuing its "Visually Impaired Agent Programme." [AR 2024, p.45, p.44]
*   **Employee Turnover (Total Employees):** While the absolute number decreased (696 in 2023 to 572 in 2024), this must be viewed in context of the overall reduced headcount. [AR 2024, p.45]

**Training and Development:**
*   **Total Training Hours (for employees only):** A consistent downward trend is observed:
    *   **2022:** 111,743 hours [AR 2024, p.42]
    *   **2023:** 98,461 hours [AR 2024, p.42]
    *   **2024:** 80,169 hours [AR 2024, p.42]. This translates to an average of 24.38 hours per employee in 2024, a significant 24% decrease from 32.06 hours in 2022. [AR 2024, p.42]
*   **GenAI Academy:** Trained over 2,000 employees in AI fundamentals in 2024. [AR 2024, p.42]
*   **Locations:** Specific quantitative breakdowns of employee distribution by functional department (e.g., Network Operations, Sales, Customer Service) or precise geographic location (beyond general office addresses) are not disclosed, limiting a granular understanding of manpower allocation and potential operational strains post-rationalization. [AR 2024, p.3, p.197]

The significant reduction in employee headcount and average training hours, while contributing to immediate staff cost optimization, introduces a substantial long-term non-financial risk. Management's claim of maintaining a "high-performing organisation" (AR 2024, p.3) appears incongruous without clearer, verifiable metrics demonstrating a corresponding increase in per-employee productivity or successful infusion of new, specialized talent. This raises concerns about potential skill gaps, employee morale, burnout, and future service degradation, which could ultimately impact customer experience and competitive standing in a technologically dynamic sector.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance, and Their Ownership

Maxis' operating assets are diverse, reflecting its integrated telco model, with a mix of owned and leased infrastructure.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

Maxis' primary geographic footprint is Malaysia, where it operates nationwide, aligning with its vision to be "The Leading Integrated Telco in Malaysia". [AR 2024, p.11]
*   **Nationwide Coverage:** The extensive 4G (96%) and 5G (82.4%) coverage is critical for serving a broad customer base. [AR 2024, p.3, p.28]
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** Collaborations like the Sarawak Digital Economy Corporation partnership (2024) demonstrate targeted regional digital transformation efforts. [AR 2024, p.5] Maxis' equity interest in Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) and advanced payments (RM233.2 million) are significant for future 5G infrastructure, especially with the impending dual 5G network model. [AR 2024, p.149, Note 21]
*   **International Presence:** Revenue from "Other countries" (primarily roaming) is a small portion (RM220 million in 2024) of total revenue, confirming a strong domestic focus. [AR 2024, p.133, Note 5]

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

Maxis has undergone several significant changes, driven by technological advancements, market competition, and strategic priorities.

*   **Workforce Reduction:** The consistent reduction in employee headcount (from 4,078 in 2022 to 3,288 in 2024) reflects "cost discipline and operational efficiency." [AR 2024, p.42; 24Q4 TS, p.18]
*   **Network Modernization and Expansion:** The 3G network shutdown, rapid increase in 5G device subscriptions (3.7 million in 2024, 50% YoY growth), and continuous fibre rollout demonstrate a commitment to network evolution. [AR 2024, p.36, p.27, p.31] Accelerated depreciation (RM5 million in 2024, RM121 million in 2023) further indicates planned technological refreshes. [AR 2024, p.143, Note 15]
*   **Digitalization and AI Adoption:** Transition to SAP S4/HANA, deployment of AI assistant "Dexter," and increasing digital self-service adoption streamline processes and enhance customer interaction. [AR 2024, p.7, p.29, p.27; 25Q1 TS, p.2]
*   **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** CAPEX notably decreased by 17% in 2024 (RM675 million) compared to 2023 (RM813 million). This trend continued into 1Q25, with a remarkably low CAPEX of RM86 million. [24Q4 FS, p.16; 25Q1 FS, p.16] While management states this reflects a "prudent approach" and "strategic focus on essential upgrades and futureproofing," (24Q4 FS, p.17; 25Q1 Pres, p.9) this sustained reduction in a capital-intensive industry warrants deeper scrutiny. Given stagnant 4G population coverage and growing blended data usage (33.2 GB/month in 1Q25), questions arise about whether Maxis is risking future network capacity, service quality, or its ability to meet growing demands and competitive pressures by potentially underinvesting. The low CAPEX, especially in light of the impending dual 5G network model (post-DNB agreement), implies a significant risk of lagging infrastructure and hindering Maxis' ambition to be "The Leading Integrated Telco."

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Maxis' operating structure leverages its network and digital capabilities to enhance competitive positioning.
*   **Network Leadership:** Extensive 4G and expanding 5G coverage are core differentiators. [AR 2024, p.3, p.28]
*   **Customer Experience (CX) Focus:** High NPS (+70 in 2024) and industry awards reflect a strong CX focus, supported by AI integration (Dexter) and digital self-service. [AR 2024, p.3, p.28, p.29]
*   **Product Innovation & Convergence:** A dual-brand strategy (Maxis for premium, Hotlink for value) and bundled propositions aim to increase customer loyalty. [AR 2024, p.30; 25Q1 TS, p.2]
*   **Enterprise Solutions:** Leveraging network infrastructure to offer advanced solutions like GPUaaS and SD-WAN, supported by strategic alliances with tech companies. [AR 2024, p.33, p.34]
*   **Digitalization and Efficiency:** Transition to SAP S4/HANA and AI tool deployment enhance operational efficiency and agility. [AR 2024, p.7]

### f. How the Operating Structure Drives Unit Economics

The operating structure contributes to unit economics through efficiency gains, cost management, and optimized resource utilization.
*   **Cost Efficiency Initiatives:** Energy management (4,372 MWh savings in 2024 from initiatives like off-grid solar and 3G shutdown) and waste management (78% recycling rate for total waste in 2024) contribute to savings and lower emissions intensity. [AR 2024, p.3, p.36, p.37, p.39] However, the noted "limited visibility of source data" and "methodology change" for water consumption (increased from 43,225 m3 in 2023 to 56,968 m3 in 2024) pose a red flag for data reliability and consistency in environmental reporting. [AR 2024, p.40]
*   **Operational Optimization:** Reducing "truck rolls" and improving Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) enhance efficiency. [AR 2024, p.32, p.29]
*   **Capacity Management:** Offloading >20% of traffic from 4G to 5G optimizes network efficiency without extensive new infrastructure, improving unit cost per GB. [AR 2024, p.28]
*   **Human Capital Efficiency:** The reduction in employee headcount directly impacts staff costs, contributing to improved EBITDA margins. However, the sustainability of these cost reductions hinges on avoiding long-term operational impairment, such as reduced service quality or employee morale issues, which are non-financial risks that need careful monitoring. While management highlights "disciplined cost management" (24Q4 TS, p.9), the impact of reduced training hours and headcount on long-term operational viability and innovation should be critically assessed.

**Overall Insight:** Maxis' operating footprint reflects a strategic pivot towards a more efficient, digitally-driven model. While management emphasizes "sustainable growth" and "operational excellence" with supporting data on cost savings and network performance, the notable and sustained reduction in CAPEX and employee training hours, coupled with significant workforce rationalization, warrants close attention. These trends, if not balanced with sufficient investment in future capabilities and human capital development, could pose long-term non-financial risks to competitive positioning, innovation capacity, and customer satisfaction, potentially impacting future unit economics. Furthermore, identified data gaps and transparency concerns in areas like employee distribution and environmental metrics limit the depth of external evaluation, raising questions about the completeness of the operational picture presented to stakeholders.
