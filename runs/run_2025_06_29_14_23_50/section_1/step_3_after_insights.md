## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or "the Group") is Singapore's oldest and one of Asia's largest manufacturers of high-end precision plastic and metal components and products, established in 1978. Listed on the Singapore Exchange since 1995, the Group offers vertically-integrated manufacturing services to a diverse international customer base across life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, and industrial sectors. Its strategically distributed operating footprint across Singapore, Malaysia, and China aims to provide comprehensive one-stop solutions from product design to assembly and testing.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions: Questioning Workforce Trajectories

Fu Yu's workforce comprises permanent, full-time employees, supplemented by temporary staff. The Group reported a decline in total headcount from 1,535 in FY2022 to 1,488 in FY2023, and further to 1,372 employees as of December 31, 2024. While seemingly a "consistent decline," **this trend is fundamentally compromised by a critical data incomparability**. The FY2024 headcount explicitly *excludes* outsourced workers for GRI alignment, whereas prior periods *included* them. Without knowing the exact number of outsourced workers in FY2022 and FY2023, it is impossible to determine if the workforce is genuinely shrinking due to operational contraction, automation efficiencies, or merely a reclassification and formal outsourcing of certain roles. This data gap prevents a like-for-like analysis of workforce trajectory.

The new hire rate for FY2024 was 26.7% (366 new employees), with a turnover rate of 24.9% (342 employees leaving), broadly within management's target of below 30% (exclusive of temporary workers). The higher proportion of temporary employees in China (130 of 530) suggests operational flexibility for fluctuating market demands. However, the decrease in average training hours per employee from 16 in FY2023 to 13.2 in FY2024, attributed to "training budget control and shift in company priorities," raises concerns. Coupled with the uncertain headcount trend, this reduction could pose a non-financial risk to long-term skill development and talent retention in a precision engineering industry highly reliant on skilled labor. It begs the question of whether short-term cost savings are prioritized over long-term capability building, especially given the ambiguity surrounding workforce composition.

*Note: FY2022 and FY2023 Group Total headcount includes outsourced workers; FY2024 Group Total explicitly excludes them, thus hindering direct year-on-year comparison of underlying permanent workforce size.*

### b. Main Operating Assets, Strategic Importance, and Ownership Structure

Fu Yu operates six strategic manufacturing sites across three countries, with over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity. Key assets include the Singapore headquarters and its flagship Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1), highlighted for its 100K-class cleanroom, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing. Additional facilities are located in Penang and Johor, Malaysia, and Dongguan, Suzhou, and Zhuhai, China.

As of December 31, 2024, the Group's property, plant and equipment (PPE) totaled S$58.603 million. Critically, **a substantial portion (approx. 71.3%) comprises "leasehold properties" or "right-of-use assets" (S$41.764 million)**, rather than outright ownership. While leasing offers flexibility and reduced upfront capital outlay, it imposes long-term lease liabilities and can limit the Group's ability to extensively customize, redevelop, or easily collateralize these assets for future financing. This high reliance on leased assets warrants further consideration regarding its alignment with the stated goal of "significant investment in advanced manufacturing," which often necessitates deep, long-term asset-specific modifications and control. An investment property in Johor, Malaysia, leased to third parties, is valued at S$7.158 million.

The strategic importance of these assets lies in their specialized capabilities (e.g., cleanroom for biomedical products, 3D printing for rapid prototyping) and geographic distribution, supporting the Group's one-stop solution model and "geographical flexibility." Investments in energy-efficient machines and solar panels underscore operational changes aimed at reducing consumption and aligning with sustainability goals.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Strategic Pivot

Fu Yu's multi-country presence is core to its business strategy, serving a diverse international customer base and offering resilience amidst geopolitical uncertainty.

The revenue data reveals a clear strategic pivot: Singapore and Malaysia's contributions to manufacturing sales have increased, while China's has declined from 41.0% in FY2022 to 27.9% in FY2024. This aligns with management's narrative of customers diversifying supply chains away from China due to geopolitical tensions. However, **a critical gap exists in the analysis: the lack of regional profitability or margin data.** While the geographic shift appears strategically sound, its ultimate financial benefit remains unquantified. Is the increased revenue from Singapore/Malaysia translating into higher overall profit margins, given the potential for higher-value work in Singapore versus lower-cost alternatives in Malaysia? Without this, the financial efficacy of the pivot is opaque. Furthermore, the absence of disclosed customer numbers prevents an assessment of customer concentration risks within these evolving revenue streams.

### d. Significant Changes and Trends: A Qualified Opinion Raises Governance Concerns

The most significant change in FY2024 was the **cessation of all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS)** in the last quarter. While stated as a strategic reallocation of resources, this decision is overshadowed by an **ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs**, which revealed "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process." **This culminated in the auditor issuing a qualified opinion on the financial statements** due to their inability to determine the potential financial impact of this ongoing investigation and alleged misuse of resources.

**This qualified audit opinion is not merely a "significant non-financial risk" but a major financial reporting red flag and severe governance issue.** It casts a material shadow over the reliability of the entire financial statements. The lack of financial magnitude (i.e., FYSCS's prior revenue/profitability contribution) further exacerbates the uncertainty. The fact that "claims against certain persons" are intended indicates potential for prolonged, costly legal battles that will distract management and impact cash flow. This situation points to potentially severe internal control weaknesses that raise questions about broader systemic issues beyond just FYSCS.

Other notable trends include:
*   **Geographic Shift in Manufacturing Focus:** As discussed, a successful strategic pivot away from China.
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing & Automation:** Continued focus on the Singapore Smart Factory, including 3D metal printing and a new ERP system, indicates a drive for higher-margin projects and operational efficiency. However, the non-financial risks of employee adaptation and morale, alongside declining training hours, warrant scrutiny.
*   **Sustainability Integration:** Installation of solar panels and waste reduction initiatives (e.g., hazardous waste decrease by 25.7%) align with ESG goals, reducing operational costs and enhancing reputation.
*   **Precision Level Advancement:** Aiming for even higher levels of precision (beyond 5-micron) is critical for competitiveness in high-end manufacturing.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu's operating structure supports its competitive positioning as a high-end precision manufacturer by:
*   **Vertically-Integrated One-Stop Solution:** Provides comprehensive services that enhance customer value and foster "sticky" long-term partnerships due to complex, high-precision tooling projects.
*   **Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities:** The Singapore Smart Factory's cleanroom and 3D metal printing enable the Group to target high-growth, high-margin sectors like biomedical and advanced technology, differentiating it from competitors.
*   **Geographical Flexibility and De-risking:** A multi-country footprint offers supply chain resilience and flexibility, appealing to customers diversifying away from China due to geopolitical tensions – a significant competitive advantage.
*   **Focus on High-Precision and NPI:** The strategic shift to high-precision manufacturing and a New Product Introduction (NPI) team adds value early in the business cycle, attracting customers in higher-margin categories.
*   **Sustainability as a Differentiator:** Investments in renewable energy and exploration of eco-friendly materials align with growing customer preferences, potentially securing new business.

Overall, Fu Yu's operating footprint demonstrates strategic adaptation to market forces through geographic diversification, advanced technological capabilities, and a commitment to sustainability and vertical integration. However, the identified strengths are significantly tempered by the highly material and unresolved issues surrounding the FYSCS investigation and its qualified audit opinion, which fundamentally undermines confidence in the Group's internal controls and financial reporting reliability. Furthermore, the lack of granular data on workforce comparability and regional profitability limits a complete assessment of the financial efficacy of its strategic shifts.
