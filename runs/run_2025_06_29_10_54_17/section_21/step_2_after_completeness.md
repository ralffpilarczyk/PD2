## SECTION 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Company" or "Fu Yu") has strategically repositioned its core manufacturing business, emphasizing high-precision capabilities and geographic diversification. This analysis identifies three key competitive advantages poised to materially impact the Company's economic performance over the next 12 months. While specific industry-wide benchmarks or named competitor data are unavailable, these internal improvements position Fu Yu for stronger performance relative to its own recent history and potentially against more commoditized industry players.

### 1. Advanced Precision Manufacturing Capabilities in High-Growth, High-Margin Segments

Fu Yu's strategic investment in its Singapore Smart Factory positions it with "one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities," capable of "manufacturing complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing," including a "100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 3). This enables the Company to target higher-margin sectors like medical technology.

This advantage is quantitatively demonstrated by:
*   **Enhanced Profitability & Pricing Power:** Manufacturing GPM increased by 1.8 ppt to 13.5% in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 8), outpacing overall Group GPM improvement. This indicates an enhanced ability to command premium pricing due to specialized capabilities, a key differentiator from more commoditized players.
*   **Growth in Key Segments:** Singapore operations (Smart Factory location) saw sales improve 20.9% to S$46.2 million in FY2024, driven by "higher sales in the medical and consumer segments," reversing a S$6.9 million LBT to a S$1.2 million PBT (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 9).
*   **Future Revenue Visibility:** New projects in "medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances" are "now ready for mass production" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). The 20% year-on-year increase in the order book further signals strong near-term revenue prospects directly linked to these capabilities (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6).

### 2. Geographically Diversified Manufacturing Footprint

Fu Yu's operational presence across Singapore, Malaysia, and China offers significant flexibility amidst global supply chain reconfigurations and geopolitical risks, particularly benefiting from the "China-plus-one" strategy (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6).

This advantage is quantitatively supported by:
*   **Successful Geographic Pivot:** While China manufacturing revenue declined 11.8% in FY2024, Singapore sales rose 20.9% and Malaysia sales grew 24.9% (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 9). This demonstrates successful demand capture outside China, de-risking operations.
*   **Improved Regional Profitability:** Singapore moved from a S$6.9 million LBT to a S$1.2 million PBT, and Malaysia's PBT grew 22.9% to S$4.3 million. Conversely, China's LBT widened (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 9). This confirms that diversification is translating into improved profitability and risk mitigation.

### 3. Deep-Rooted Customer Relationships and High Customer Retention

With over "45 years of operating knowledge," Fu Yu has cultivated a "diverse and loyal customer base" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 3). The nature of high-precision tooling and "vertically-integrated manufacturing services" inherently fosters long-term, "sticky" customer relationships (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 3, 6, 18).

This advantage is evidenced by:
*   **Sustained Revenue Growth from Existing Customers:** The 10.5% manufacturing revenue growth in FY2024 was primarily driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers, as well as new projects secured" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5). This robust performance from existing clients strongly implies high customer retention, although specific retention rates are not disclosed.
*   **Strong Order Book:** The 20% year-on-year increase in the order book reflects continued demand and confidence from its established customer base (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6). The Chairman's comment on the "relatively 'sticky' nature of projects involving high-precision tooling" directly links this qualitative strength to "long-term sustainable revenue" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6).

### Financial Prospects and Critical Stance

These competitive advantages directly contribute to Fu Yu's superior financial prospects relative to its own recent performance, positioning it for recovery. The combined effect of higher-margin precision work, successful geographic de-risking, and strong customer relationships contributed to the manufacturing segment's GPM improvement to 13.5% and a sharp narrowing of the Group's net loss from S$10.1 million in FY2023 to S$3.9 million in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 8). The Singapore segment's return to profitability is a clear indicator of strategic success.

However, a critical stance notes that this "improvement" is relative to a very poor FY2023, and the Company remains in a net loss position for FY2024. Furthermore, the optimistic manufacturing outlook is significantly overshadowed by the "ongoing investigation into the affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd. ('FYSCS')" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 101, Note 32). This discontinued operation incurred a S$3.3 million impairment in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6), and is subject to "significant weaknesses" and potential claims. The auditor issued a qualified opinion, unable to determine the full financial impact (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 104). While the Company states the investigation "do[es] not impact our continuing operations" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 6), the associated legal and financial clean-up could divert resources and impact overall Group sentiment and investor confidence.

The Companyâ€™s ability to sustain its improved manufacturing margins and capitalize on its order book growth will be key to achieving overall Group profitability in the next 12 months, provided the FYSCS issues are contained. Without comparative data from named competitors or industry-wide benchmarks, it is challenging to definitively declare "superior financial prospects relative to industry averages," but the internal trajectory suggests a strengthening competitive position.
