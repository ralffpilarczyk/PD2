ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
- **Prioritize Root Cause and Driver Analysis:** Focus on identifying the underlying reasons for financial outcomes (e.g., *why* revenue increased, *why* margins declined) rather than just reporting the change. This deep dive into causal factors generated the most valuable insights for strategic action.
- **Systematically Employ Ratio and Trend Analysis:** Consistent application of key financial ratios (profitability, liquidity, efficiency) alongside multi-period trend analysis provides immediate context and highlights areas of strength or concern, revealing the health and direction of the financial performance.
- **Deconstruct Aggregate Figures into Contributing Segments:** Breaking down high-level numbers (e.g., total revenue, operating expenses) by product line, geography, or business unit effectively pinpointed specific areas of over/under-performance and revealed granular insights missed in aggregate views.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
- **Conduct a Comprehensive Initial Scoping and Data Checklist:** Before drafting, define all required financial statements, historical periods, external benchmarks, and qualitative data points to ensure completeness from the outset. This would have prevented subsequent "completeness improvements."
- **Proactively Define Key Analytical Questions and Hypotheses:** Instead of merely presenting data, formulate specific questions (e.g., "Is the company's working capital management efficient?") or hypotheses (e.g., "Profitability issues stem from rising COGS, not revenue stagnation") to guide the initial analysis and drive insight generation.
- **Always Articulate the "So What?" and Actionability of Findings:** From the very first draft, challenge each financial observation with "So what does this mean?" or "What are the implications for decision-making?" to ensure findings transition from descriptive to actionable insights.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
- **Mandate Integrated Analysis Across All Three Core Financial Statements:** Go beyond just P&L; always connect the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement to provide a holistic view of financial health (e.g., how changes in receivables impact operating cash flow). Missing this integration is a common oversight that diminishes analytical depth.
- **Prioritize Analysis of Performance Drivers and Future Implications:** The most valuable depth comes from explaining *why* numbers changed and what these changes imply for future performance (outlook, risks, opportunities), rather than just presenting current or historical figures.
- **Dedicate Specific Sections to Financial Risks, Opportunities, and Qualitative Context:** Beyond the numbers, providing context on market conditions, competitive landscape, regulatory changes, or internal operational shifts helps explain financial outcomes and is often missed but highly valuable for a complete picture.
- **Structure the Narrative Logically from Overview to Granular Detail:** A clear flow, typically starting with high-level performance (P&L), moving to underlying health (Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), then detailed drivers, and finally future outlook/risks, ensures the analysis is comprehensive, coherent, and easily digestible.
