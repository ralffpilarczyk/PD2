The provided appendix draft demonstrates a strong adherence to the core instruction of **"DO NOT OMIT ANY DATA."** All numerical data and tables from the implied source documents appear to be fully transcribed, with clear source notations for each. The Markdown formatting for individual tables is consistently well-executed.

However, the appendix can be significantly improved in terms of **DATA COMPLETENESS** by addressing redundancies and optimizing the **ORGANIZATION** and **COMBINATION OF TIME PERIODS** as per the specific requirements.

**Specific Gaps and Recommendations:**

1.  **DATA COMPLETENESS (Addressing Redundancy & Suboptimal Integration):**
    *   **No data is *omitted* from the provided markdown draft.** All tables and their content appear to be fully transcribed. The "N/R" notes correctly indicate data not reported in the original source tables, not omissions by the drafter.
    *   **However, there are instances of *redundancy* and *suboptimal integration* of data across tables, which, while not an "omission," goes against the spirit of "single, clean, comprehensive, and logically structured appendix" and "Combine Time Periods Intelligently."**

    *   **Section 2: Consolidated Financials - Summary vs. Detailed Statements:**
        *   **Gap:** The "Financial Highlights" tables (`Financial Highlights - Income Statement Summary Continuing Operations`, `Financial Highlights - Balance Sheet Summary`, `Financial Highlights - Key Financial Ratios`, `1H2024 Snapshot`, `1H2024 Gross and Net Profit Review`, `Yearly Financial Performance`, `Strong Financial Position`, `Net Profit from Continuing Operations`, `Earnings Per Ordinary Share`, `Net Asset Value Per Ordinary Share`) present summary data that is either duplicated or a subset of information found in the more detailed "Condensed Interim Statements" (Financial Position, Income Statement, Cash Flow).
        *   **Recommendation:** While highlights can be useful, for a *data completeness* appendix, the detailed statements should precede or be the primary source. Reorder Section 2 to prioritize the comprehensive "Condensed Interim Statements" first. Then, consider if the "Financial Highlights" tables can be integrated into the main statements (e.g., by adding columns for different time periods if not already present) or if they should remain as separate, clearly labeled summary tables *after* the detailed statements. The current arrangement of highlights preceding detailed statements is less logical for a comprehensive data appendix.

    *   **Section 3: Supporting Financials - Tax Data Duplication:**
        *   **Gap:** `Tax Expense/(Credit)` (from Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 139) and `Tax (Credit)/Expense` (from Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, Page 25) contain overlapping data for FY2024 and FY2023, but the latter also includes 2H data.
        *   **Recommendation:** Combine these two tax tables into a single, comprehensive table, using the more granular time periods available (2H and FY). This improves data completeness by presenting all related tax data in one place.
        *   **Gap:** Similarly, `Loss for the Year` (from Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 138) and `Profit/(Loss) Before Income Tax (Continuing Operations)` (from Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, Page 24) contain overlapping line items (e.g., depreciation, interest expenses, share-based payments) but for different time periods (FY vs. 2H/FY).
        *   **Recommendation:** Review these tables for potential combination or re-structuring to present a single, comprehensive view of these expense breakdowns across all available time periods (2H and FY).

    *   **Section 4: Segment Reporting - Manufacturing Revenue Duplication:**
        *   **Gap:** The `Manufacturing Revenue by Geography` table (from Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, Page 5) is entirely redundant. Its data (1H2024 and 1H2023 manufacturing revenue by Singapore, Malaysia, China) is already fully captured within the more detailed `Disaggregation of Revenue from Contracts with Customers` table.
        *   **Recommendation:** Remove the `Manufacturing Revenue by Geography` table to eliminate redundancy and streamline the appendix.

    *   **Section 5: Shareholder & Governance Data - Issued Shares Duplication/Formatting:**
        *   **Gap:** The `Total Number of Issued Shares` is presented as a single line of text. Its numerical data (761,994,775 for 2024 and 756,994,775 for 2023) is already precisely replicated in the `Share Capital` table (from Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 131) in Section 3.
        *   **Recommendation:** Remove this standalone text entry. The information is already accurately and appropriately presented within a structured table in the "Supporting Financials" section.

2.  **ORGANIZATION:**
    *   **Gap:** The current order of tables within "Consolidated Financials" (Section 2) places summary "Financial Highlights" before the detailed "Condensed Interim Statements."
    *   **Recommendation:** Reorder Section 2 to follow the standard financial prospectus structure:
        *   Start with the full, detailed financial statements (e.g., `Condensed Interim Statements of Financial Position (Unaudited)`, `Condensed Interim Consolidated Income Statement (Unaudited)`, `Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Unaudited)`, `Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Unaudited)`, `Condensed Interim Statements of Changes in Equity - Company (Unaudited)`).
        *   Follow with the various summary tables, highlights, and key ratios. This provides a logical flow from detailed data to high-level summaries.

3.  **FORMAT:**
    *   The Markdown formatting for tables is generally excellent.
    *   The only specific formatting issue is the `Total Number of Issued Shares` in Section 5, which is a text line instead of a table. This is covered by the redundancy point above.

4.  **SOURCES:**
    *   All tables correctly include `*(Source: ...)*` information. Headings generally reflect source titles. This is well done.

5.  **UNWANTED CONTENT:**
    *   There are no analytical narratives or summaries outside of the tables themselves. This is in line with the instructions.

By implementing these recommendations, the appendix will become even more "clean, comprehensive, and logically structured," fulfilling the requirements more completely by eliminating redundancy and optimizing data presentation.
