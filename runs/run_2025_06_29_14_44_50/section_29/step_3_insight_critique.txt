## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance - CRITIQUE

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's ("Fu Yu") core manufacturing segment has demonstrated a positive trajectory over the last 24 months, particularly in the most recent financial year. Strategic transformation initiatives have driven robust revenue growth, significant gross profit margin (GPM) expansion, and a strong increase in its order book. This indicates improving operational efficiency and market traction in high-precision manufacturing. This performance is crucial given the strategic discontinuation of its supply chain management (SCM) services, which significantly masked Group-level growth.

This analysis focuses on three critical operating metrics materially impacting Fu Yu's economic performance: **Manufacturing Revenue**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **Order Book Growth**. While some metrics appear on financial statements, our focus is on underlying operational drivers and implications. **A key limitation for buy-side due diligence is the absence of quantifiable market share, comprehensive asset utilization rates, and direct industry benchmarks from public documents.** This severely limits external comparative analysis and the ability to definitively assess Fu Yu's competitive positioning or relative efficiency.

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue

**Analysis:** Manufacturing revenue grew 10.5% year-on-year in FY2024 (S$103.9M to S$114.9M) [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. This growth is vital in offsetting the SCM segment's decline, which resulted in only a marginal 0.5% overall Group revenue increase [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 7]. The stated growth drivers include higher order volumes from existing customers and new project wins in high-margin biomedical, medical device, drone technology, and smart appliance sectors [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. These wins are reportedly supported by investments in advanced tooling and the New Product Introduction (NPI) team.

A significant geographical shift is evident, with increased sales from Singapore (+20.9%) and Malaysia (+24.9%) operations mitigating an 11.8% decline in China operations [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 8]. While presented as a strategic de-risking move amid geopolitical uncertainties, the analysis lacks clarity on whether the China decline implies customer attrition (i.e., loss of relationships) or merely a relocation of existing customer production away from China to Fu Yu's other facilities. This distinction is critical for assessing true customer stickiness and market share evolution. The "sticky" nature of high-precision tooling projects implies sustainability, but the acknowledged external headwinds from geopolitical uncertainties and China's slower economic recovery could still pose future risks, requiring closer quantitative scrutiny.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
*   What is the weighted average contract length/expected revenue lifespan for FY2024's new high-precision projects, and what are their projected revenue contributions for FY2025-2026?
*   Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing revenue growth between volume increases, new customer acquisition, and pricing adjustments over the last 24 months? This is crucial for assessing revenue quality.
*   Does the decline in China operations represent customer attrition or a strategic shift of existing customers' production away from China to Fu Yu's other facilities?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Analysis:** Manufacturing GPM expanded significantly from 17.5% in FY2023 to 20.3% in FY2024, a 2.8 percentage point increase that materially boosted gross profit by S$5.8 million [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. This expansion is primarily attributed to an improved product mix towards higher-value, higher-margin projects, aligning with the revenue growth drivers.

While claims of operational efficiency gains (e.g., reduced energy intensity due to automation, labour optimization, higher machinery utilization) [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6] are positive, they lack specific quantification. This prevents independent verification of their actual impact on margins. Similarly, while "pricing power" is cited, its contribution is not explicitly broken down in the revenue figures, creating an analytical gap regarding how this power is being realized.

Most critically, the assertion that production costs are *lower* in Malaysia and Singapore compared to China for the current product mix is highly counter-intuitive for manufacturing. China is typically associated with lower overall manufacturing costs. This claim demands deep investigation into its underlying logic, whether it's related to tax incentives, a shift to higher automation outside China, or specific supply chain advantages for their niche products. Without granular cost breakdowns by region and product line, this remains a significant analytical gap and potential red flag for a buyer.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
*   Can management quantify specific cost savings from automation, labour optimization, and reduced energy intensity, providing historical data (e.g., energy consumption per unit, labour cost per unit, or capacity utilization rates)?
*   How are production costs in Singapore and Malaysia lower than China for the current product mix? Provide granular breakdown of labour, raw material, and overhead costs by region and product line.
*   What is the specific evidence of increased pricing power, and how does this translate into a quantifiable price component in revenue growth?

### 3. Order Book Growth

**Analysis:** Fu Yu reports a "strong increase in order book" with "new project wins expected to transition into long-term revenue streams" [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. While qualitatively positive, driven by new project wins in high-growth sectors, deepening customer relationships, and strategic geographical diversification, **no quantifiable data** (monetary value, volume, or duration) is provided in public documents.

This represents a critical analytical limitation for buy-side due diligence. It prevents independent verification of future revenue visibility and the "highly sustainable" nature claimed by the Company. Without specific figures, its true financial impact and future contribution remain speculative. The lack of this fundamental metric is a significant red flag that a buyer must prioritize investigating to gauge future performance.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
*   Can management provide a quantified breakdown of the current order book by value, customer type (new vs. existing), key product category, and expected revenue recognition timeline (e.g., 12-month, 24-month, 36-month pipeline)?
*   What are the typical cancellation rates for these high-precision manufacturing orders, and how do they compare to industry averages?
*   What is the average contract length/revenue lifespan for "long-term revenue streams," and what proportion of the current order book is attributable to such contracts?
