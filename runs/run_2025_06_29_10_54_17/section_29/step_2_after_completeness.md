## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance for the last 24 months shows a positive trajectory, primarily driven by robust manufacturing revenue growth, expanding gross profit margins, and a notable reduction in environmental intensity. This improvement suggests benefits from strategic pivots towards high-precision manufacturing and investments in efficiency and sustainability. However, the cessation of the supply chain management services segment, amidst an ongoing investigation, indicates the "reallocation of resources" may be a forced rather than purely strategic move, introducing a critical caveat to the overall operational narrative (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.30).

### Top 3 Most Important Operating Metrics:

The three most important operating metrics materially impacting Fu Yu Corporation Limited's economic performance over the last 24 months are **Manufacturing Revenue Growth**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **GHG Emissions Intensity**. While direct asset utilization metrics were not quantitatively available, GHG Emissions Intensity reflects operational efficiency with quantifiable cost and revenue implications, making it a critical operating consideration in today's market.

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue Growth

**Definition and Relevance:**
Manufacturing Revenue Growth measures the percentage increase in sales from the Company's core manufacturing operations (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). This metric directly reflects market demand, sales effectiveness, and the ability to expand customer relationships and market share, indicating underlying volumes and/or favorable pricing.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                | Period    | Value (S$ Million) | Growth (%)       | Source                                       |
|:----------------------|:----------|:-------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Manufacturing Revenue | FY2023    | 103.9              | N/A              | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4         |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H1 2023   | 52.6               | N/A              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)*            |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H2 2023   | 51.3               | N/A              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                          |
| Manufacturing Revenue | FY2024    | 114.9              | 10.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4         |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H1 2024   | 54.8               | 4.06% (YoY H1)   | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)*            |
| Manufacturing Revenue | H2 2024   | 60.1               | 17.18% (YoY H2)  | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                          |

**Benchmarking:**
No direct industry-specific benchmarks are provided. However, 10.5% growth in FY2024 is significant amid a "challenging operating environment" and "slower-than-expected recovery in China's economy" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 8; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31).

**Analysis of Drivers:**
Growth was driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.30). A New Product Introduction (NPI) team and advanced tooling capabilities facilitated wins in higher-margin product categories (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). Strong Singapore (+20.9% to S$46.2M) and Malaysia (+24.9% to S$36.6M) growth offset an 11.8% decline in China (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8).

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
Growth appears sustainable due to:
*   **Increased Order Book:** 20% YoY increase in FY2024, with "higher order volumes and interest in increasing order volumes from existing customers" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31).
*   **"Sticky" Projects:** High-precision tooling projects translate to "long-term sustainable revenue" as they transition to mass production (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31).
*   **Geographical Flexibility:** Production in Singapore, Malaysia, and China offers flexibility amidst geopolitical uncertainties (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:**
The S$11.0 million (10.5%) manufacturing revenue growth for FY2024 was the primary driver for the Group's overall revenue increase of S$0.9 million (0.5%), despite a S$10.0 million decline in the discontinued supply chain segment (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). This growth significantly narrowed the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million (FY2023) to S$1.2 million (FY2024) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7).

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What is the specific breakdown of the 20% year-on-year order book increase at FY2024 by customer (new vs. existing) and product segment, and what is the anticipated revenue conversion rate from this order book for FY2025 and FY2026?
2.  Given the decline in China operations, what specific strategic adjustments and customer acquisition plans are in place to mitigate further revenue risk from this region, and what is the expected timeline for its recovery?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Definition and Relevance:**
Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin is the gross profit from the manufacturing segment as a percentage of its revenue. It indicates pricing power, cost control effectiveness, and the profitability of core production processes (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). Higher GPM reflects efficient operations and favorable unit economics.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                     | Period  | Value   | Change (ppt) | Source                |
|:---------------------------|:--------|:--------|:-------------|:----------------------|
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | FY2023  | S$12.1M | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM          | FY2023  | 11.7%   | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H1 2023 | 9.7%    | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H2 2023 | 13.6%   | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit | FY2024  | S$15.5M | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM          | FY2024  | 13.5%   | +1.8 ppt     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H1 2024 | 12.8%   | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)** |
| Manufacturing GPM          | H2 2024 | 14.1%   | N/A          | Fu Yu FS Q44, p.13 (calculated)** |

**Benchmarking:**
Direct GPM benchmarks are not available in the documents. However, the improvement from 11.7% to 13.5% (FY2023 to FY2024) signals a positive trend, especially with the strategic shift towards "higher-margin product categories" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Analysis of Drivers:**
The 1.8 percentage point GPM improvement was driven by a strategic transformation focusing on "high-precision manufacturing" and securing "new projects... particularly those in higher-margin product categories" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). The NPI team enabled these wins, demonstrating the ability to "add value in the early stages of the business cycle" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
Sustained GPM improvement is likely due to the Company's stated strategies. The focus on "high-precision projects" and "moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6), supported by the Smart Factory's capabilities in complex mould inserts and 3D metal printing, underpins this trend (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2, 6).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:**
The 1.8 percentage point GPM increase (11.7% to 13.5%) resulted in an S$3.4 million increase in manufacturing gross profit (S$15.5M in FY2024 vs. S$12.1M in FY2023) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). This significant contribution was a key factor in narrowing the Group's net loss from continuing operations.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  Can management provide a segment-level gross profit margin breakdown for the manufacturing business by key product categories (e.g., medical devices, consumer products, industrial) for the last 24 months, to understand the drivers of margin expansion and the sustainability of the "higher-margin product categories" strategy?
2.  What is the Company's strategy for managing raw material costs and labor productivity in the manufacturing segment to sustain or further improve GPM, especially as order volumes increase?

### 3. GHG Emissions Intensity (Manufacturing Segment)

**Definition and Relevance:**
GHG Emissions Intensity measures total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per S$ million of manufacturing revenue (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40). This metric indicates environmental efficiency, compliance risk (e.g., carbon taxes), energy cost efficiency, brand reputation, and access to "green" financing.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                        | Period | Value (tCO2e/S$ mil revenue) | Reduction (%)   | Source          |
|:------------------------------|:-------|:-----------------------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| GHG Emissions Intensity       | FY2023 | 214.4                        | N/A             | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| GHG Emissions Intensity       | FY2024 | 191.9                        | 10.5% (YoY)     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| Total Electricity Consumption | FY2023 | 116,481.6 GJ                 | N/A             | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |
| Total Electricity Consumption | FY2024 | 113,623.0 GJ                 | 2.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |

**Benchmarking:**
No specific industry benchmark is provided. A 10.5% reduction in GHG emissions intensity YoY is a significant improvement, exceeding the short-term target of 3.0% (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.41).

**Analysis of Drivers:**
The reduction in GHG Emissions Intensity stems from:
1.  **Energy Efficiency:** Investment in energy-efficient electric machines and LED lighting, leading to a 2.5% decrease in purchased electricity (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38).
2.  **Renewable Energy:** Solar panel installation at Singapore facilities (FY2024 completion) and ongoing expansion in Malaysia; 4,001.8 GJ of solar energy generated on-site in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 38, 47).
3.  **Operational Optimization:** Reduced machinery idling time and use of frequency conversion air compressors (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38).

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
This trend is highly sustainable due to ongoing strategic investments and explicit targets. The Company is actively "exploring and implementing cleaner energy solutions" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.17), with Smart Factory capabilities aiding optimization (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.47).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:**
The 2.5% reduction in purchased electricity (2,858.6 GJ) directly contributes to **cost savings** on energy bills, mitigating "the impact of rising energy costs" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.32, 38). Generation of 4,001.8 GJ of solar energy provides energy cost stability. Furthermore, generating and selling Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) (3,996.0 GJ in FY2024) offers a direct **revenue opportunity** (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38). Indirectly, robust climate practices lead to "improved access to capital, and opportunities for green financing" and "increased investor confidence" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.37).

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  Can the Company provide a quantified breakdown of the energy cost savings (actual and projected for FY2025) derived from efficiency improvements and solar panel installations in each region, and how these savings impact the overall cost per unit of production?
2.  What is the detailed roadmap and capital expenditure plan to achieve the 30% Scope 2 emissions reduction target by FY2030, including specific technology upgrades, estimated costs, and anticipated financial returns on these investments?
