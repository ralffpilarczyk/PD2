## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

**Overview:**
Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") is a Singapore-headquartered precision plastic and metal components manufacturer with a vertically-integrated business model. The Group's operational footprint is diversified across six strategic manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China, spanning over 1.5 million square feet of production capacity. This distribution supports its strategy of providing a one-stop solution to customers while adapting to global supply chain dynamics. Recent changes include the strategic discontinuation of the supply chain management services segment and increased focus on high-precision manufacturing, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia.

### a. Geographic Footprint and Main Operating Assets

The Group operates through a network of wholly-owned subsidiaries across three key Asian countries, enabling geographical flexibility and supporting its international customer base.

**Key Operating Sites & Strategic Importance:**
The Group's six manufacturing sites are strategically located across:
*   **Singapore:** Focuses on high-precision tooling and manufacturing, including the advanced Smart Factory with 100K-class cleanroom facilities and over 9,348 sqm of usable space. This site is crucial for high-value, high-precision products in sectors like life sciences, medical, and automotive.
*   **Malaysia (Johor and Penang):** Supports a broader range of manufacturing activities, offering cost-effectiveness and an alternative production base, aligning with customer demands for supply chain diversification.
*   **China (Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen):** Continues to provide significant manufacturing capacity, though the Group is strategically re-aligning its revenue contribution away from this region.

**Ownership of Key Assets:**
As of 31 December 2024, the Group's property, plant, and equipment (PPE) had a carrying amount of S$58.603 million, with a significant portion being owned. This indicates direct control over core manufacturing infrastructure. Additionally, some leasehold properties are utilized to support operations, and investment property (leased to third parties) had a carrying amount of S$5.842 million. While the total value of owned assets is provided, specific historical operational data on the square footage or distinct capacity metrics *per site* (e.g., number of machines per facility, specific cleanroom sizes by location) for the last three years or five interim periods is not disclosed in the provided documents.

### d. Significant Changes and Trends in Operating Footprint

**1. Discontinuation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):**
The Group ceased all business activities in its supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) in the last quarter of FY2024. Management commentary states this was due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business." However, financial disclosures and auditor's reports reveal a more critical underlying issue: FYSCS was subjected to an internal audit in July 2024, highlighting "significant weaknesses" in its risk management, including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," and "irregular expense claims." An ongoing investigation with external legal and accounting firms (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd) is in progress, with claims intended against "certain persons" related to misuse of resources and prepaid commissions. This indicates a significant internal control failure rather than merely a leadership gap, posing a material financial and reputational risk that management's public commentary appears to downplay.

Ltd."; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.26, "Discontinued Operations".

**2. Geographical Revenue Re-alignment (Manufacturing Segment):**
The Group is actively shifting its manufacturing revenue away from China, aligning with its strategy to offer geographical flexibility amidst geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain shifts.

*Note: The provided financial statements (Q424) offer this geographical revenue breakdown annually for the manufacturing segment, but do not provide these percentages for individual interim periods (Q1, Q2, Q3) within FY2024.*

**3. Employee Headcount & Turnover Trends:**
Overall employee numbers have decreased over the last three years. While new hire rates were very high in FY2022 and FY2023 (likely reflecting high churn or expansion), they significantly reduced in FY2024. Concurrently, turnover rates, while still notable, have also decreased in FY2024, which could indicate a period of stabilization after prior volatility. Management aims to maintain turnover (excluding temporary workers) below 30% going forward.

**4. Investments in Technology and Sustainability:**
The Group continues to invest in its Smart Factory (e.g., ERP system, automation tools for overnight production, 3D printing for rapid prototyping) and renewable energy (solar panels across Singapore, Johor, and Penang facilities). These efforts aim to enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and lower carbon emissions.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The Group's operating footprint is strategically designed to enhance its competitive positioning through several key aspects:

1.  **Vertical Integration and One-Stop Solution:** By offering product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing, Fu Yu provides comprehensive, one-stop manufacturing services. This integration increases value-add for customers, fosters long-term partnerships, and differentiates it from less integrated competitors.
    <sup>6</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.18, "Our Business".
2.  **Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities:** The Singapore Smart Factory, with its high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and 100K-class cleanroom, positions Fu Yu at the forefront of advanced manufacturing. This enables the Group to target high-margin sectors like life sciences, medical, and automotive, supporting its strategic shift towards higher-value products. The ability to stabilize 5-micron precision products further enhances this capability.
    <sup>7</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE".
3.  **Geographical Flexibility & Supply Chain Resilience:** Operating in Singapore, Malaysia, and China allows the Group to offer geographical diversification in a volatile geopolitical environment. This flexibility is critical as customers seek to de-risk their supply chains away from a single country of origin, particularly China. The strategic shift of revenue contribution towards Singapore and Malaysia reflects this adaptation and resilience.
    <sup>8</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance".
4.  **Operational Efficiency and Sustainability:** Investments in Industry 4.0 machinery, automation (reducing toolroom downtime by 40%), and an integrated cloud-based ERP platform aim to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance quality. The adoption of solar energy and focus on eco-friendly materials (e.g., biodegradable bio-resin) caters to growing customer demand for sustainable products and contributes to a "greener, more responsible footprint," which can also improve access to capital.

5.  **Focus on New Product Introduction (NPI):** The NPI team's role in the early stages of the business cycle helps secure new projects in higher-margin categories, building customer confidence and ensuring long-term revenue streams. The increased order book (+20% YoY) is an early indicator of success from this strategy.
