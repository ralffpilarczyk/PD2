## SECTION 8: Summary Financials (Segment) - Expert Business Analyst Analysis

This section analyzes Maxis' financial performance by business segment, drawing insights from the Integrated Annual Report 2024 (AR 2024), Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Statements (24Q4 FS), First Quarter 2025 Financial Statements (25Q1 FS), and First Quarter 2025 Presentation (25Q1 Pres).

### a. Segment Data and Definitions

Maxis operates primarily across three core business segments:
*   **Mobile:** Encompasses Postpaid and Prepaid plans, offering voice, data, and digital services. This segment targets both premium and value-driven consumers.
*   **Home:** Provides high-speed fibre and wireless broadband (WBB) solutions, transforming homes into digital living spaces. This segment focuses on expanding fibre footprint and enhancing in-home connectivity.
*   **Enterprise:** Offers a comprehensive portfolio of enterprise products and ICT solutions, including connectivity, IoT, cloud, AI, and cybersecurity, tailored for corporates, mid-market, SMEs, wholesale, and the public sector.

It is important to note that Maxis' internal reporting and public disclosures do not provide a full breakdown of operating income (EBITDA/EBIT) or assets by individual business segment. The company states that "Segment reporting is not presented as the Group is primarily engaged in providing converged telecommunications services and solutions in Malaysia, whereby the measurement of profit or loss including EBIT... is on a Group basis." Furthermore, while Maxis defines "Mobile" and "Home" as distinct segments, their public financial reporting aggregates these into "Consumer Business Revenue." This aggregation limits granular segment-level profitability and asset efficiency analysis, potentially masking performance disparities or resource allocation effectiveness between Mobile and Home. This opacity impacts a comprehensive investor valuation and understanding of internal capital allocation drivers.

### b. Time Periods and Segment-Specific Forecasts

The analysis covers:
*   **Last 3 Financial Years:** FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024.
*   **5 Most Recent Quarters:** 1Q24, 2Q24, 3Q24, 4Q24, and 1Q25.
*   **Segment-Specific Forecasts/Guidance:** Maxis provides overall group-level guidance for FY22025, which implicitly covers all segments. For FY2025, Maxis projects a low single-digit growth in service revenue, flat to low single-digit growth in EBITDA, and CAPEX spending to remain less than RM1 billion [4, p.20]. This group-level guidance necessitates an inferential approach to segment-specific outlooks, considering individual segment challenges and growth drivers.

### c. Additional Data

*   **One-time items by segment:** Specific one-time items are not broken down by segment. The increase in FY2024 Profit After Tax (PAT) was partly due to "one-off adjustments incurred in the prior financial year of FY2023" [1, p.9]. An additional one-time dividend for Q4 2024 was also declared [1, p.5].
*   **Segment-specific metrics:** Key metrics like Revenue Generating Subscribers (RGS), Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for Postpaid, Prepaid, and Home Connectivity, Home Connections, and 5G device subscriptions/penetration are provided. The historical visibility of these operational metrics is inconsistent, with many marked as "N/A" for earlier years, hindering robust long-term trend analysis at the sub-segment level.
*   **Inter-segment transactions:** Inter-company transactions are eliminated in consolidation and are not detailed by segment [1, p.106].

#### Segment Analysis

*   **Growth Trends by Segment:**
    *   **Consumer Business:** Remains the largest revenue contributor. Annually, Consumer revenue grew by 2.7% in FY2024 to RM7.26 billion [1, p.8]. Quarterly trends show recent volatility, with a dip in 1Q25 to RM1,773 million (down 2.7% QoQ and 1.7% YoY) [5, p.17]. This decline is attributed to changes in the Maxis Device Care offering and reduced interconnect rates [5, p.17]. Within Consumer, Postpaid subscriptions show consistent volume growth (up 9.1% YoY in 1Q25 to 3.98 million subscribers) [4, p.20], suggesting a focus on customer acquisition. However, the declining ARPU (from RM75.1 in 1Q24 to RM71.8 in 1Q25) raises questions about the *quality* of this growth, potentially indicating a shift towards lower-ARPU plans or increased competition. Prepaid subscriptions remained relatively stable in volume but with consistently declining ARPU (from RM37.2 to RM34.3), signaling persistent competition and value-seeking behavior. Home Connections show steady growth, increasing 4.5% YoY in FY2024 to 784,000 [1, p.8].
    *   **Enterprise Business:** Demonstrates robust growth annually, increasing by 6.8% in FY2024 to RM1.61 billion [1, p.8]. Quarterly, Enterprise revenue in 1Q25 was RM398 million, up 2.8% YoY, but notably down 6.6% QoQ [5, p.17]. This QoQ decline, attributed to higher non-recurring revenue in the previous quarter from project completions [5, p.17], highlights a potential *volatility* in this segment's revenue stream, demanding consistent project pipeline and recurring service contracts.
    *   **5G Adoption:** Maxis has shown strong progress in 5G adoption, with subscriptions growing 50% to 3.7 million users and penetration increasing from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024 [1, p.27]. This demonstrates successful inclusive 5G propositions. However, the emergence of a "second 5G network has presented new challenges" [1, p.7], introducing uncertainty and potential increased competition in the 5G wholesale market. Maxis' ability to maintain this competitive advantage will depend on its long-term strategy in a dual-network model.

*   **Margin Evolution by Segment:**
    *   As segment-level operating income (EBITDA/EBIT) is not disclosed, a direct margin analysis by segment is not possible. This aggregation prevents investors from assessing the relative profitability and operational efficiency of the higher-growth Enterprise segment versus the larger Consumer segment. However, the overall **Group EBITDA margin on service revenue** improved from 46.2% in FY2023 to 46.5% in FY2024 [1, p.10], indicating effective cost management. In 1Q25, this margin further improved to 48.6% from 43.8% in 4Q24, driven by "lower device costs" and "effective cost management" [5, p.17]. The faster growth in the Enterprise segment (6.8% vs. 2.7% for Consumer) likely positively contributed to the overall margin improvement, given that enterprise solutions often carry higher margins than consumer connectivity. Maxis' FY2024 EBITDA margin of 46.5% is generally competitive within established regional telecommunications operators, reflecting effective cost management in a mature market, but it should be critically assessed whether this is sufficient to fuel future growth and innovation in a competitive landscape.

*   **Asset Efficiency by Segment:**
    *   Due to the absence of segment-specific asset data, a detailed analysis of asset efficiency by segment cannot be performed. However, at the group level, the **Asset Turnover Ratio** improved from 0.447x in FY2023 (10,180 / 22,781) to 0.472x in FY2024 (10,536 / 22,323). This slight increase (as total assets slightly decreased while revenue increased) suggests an improvement in overall asset utilization, but without segment breakdown, it's impossible to identify which segment is driving this efficiency.

#### Contribution Analysis

*   **Segment Performance Comparison:**
    *   The **Consumer segment** remains the dominant revenue driver, contributing approximately 82% of service revenue in FY2024 (RM7.26B Consumer / RM8.87B Service Revenue) [1, p.8]. Its growth is primarily volume-driven (Postpaid subscriptions, Home connections) though declining ARPU trends (especially Prepaid) need careful monitoring as they signal intense competition and potential profitability pressure. Maxis' strategy to "encourag[e] prepaid customers to transition to postpaid plans" [1, p.8] is a valid response, but its cost, effectiveness, and long-term feasibility in a value-driven market remain critical unquantified factors.
    *   The **Enterprise segment**, while smaller, is growing at a faster rate (6.8% in FY2024 vs. 2.7% for Consumer) [1, p.8], highlighting its increasing importance as a growth engine and a diversification strategy beyond traditional consumer mobile services. However, its reliance on "non-recurring revenue" suggests potential volatility and the need for a robust, consistent pipeline of new projects.
*   **Segment Contribution to Overall Results:**
    *   The Consumer segment's sheer volume dictates overall revenue trends. However, the Enterprise segment's higher growth rate provides a crucial boost to overall service revenue growth, which was 3.5% in FY2024 [1, p.8]. The overall EBITDA and PAT improvements are a result of combined segment performance and disciplined cost management across the entire organization.
*   **Strategic Importance by Segment:**
    *   **Consumer:** Remains the bedrock, providing stable, recurring revenue and a large subscriber base. Strategic focus on "bundling and cross-selling to construct consumer fortress" [4, p.3] aims to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn in a competitive market.
    *   **Enterprise:** Increasingly strategic for future growth and diversification. Maxis' focus on "telco adjacent services" (managed services, cloud, IoT, cybersecurity) [4, p.3] aligns with broader digital transformation trends in Malaysia. This segment offers higher growth potential and potentially higher-value services, but also comes with "new business risk" and "competition risk" [1, p.22-23] in evolving markets.
    *   **5G:** Critical for both segments, enabling next-generation services, enhancing customer experience, and unlocking new enterprise solutions. Maxis' leadership in 5G adoption is a competitive advantage [1, p.27], but its evolution in a dual-network competitive landscape (following the "recent award of the second 5G network" [1, p.7]) needs careful strategic navigation to retain this edge.

#### Cash Flow Assessment by Segment (Group-level only)

While titled "Cash Flow Assessment by Segment", it is crucial to reiterate that segment-specific cash flow is *not* disclosed, severely limiting granular analysis. This aggregation can obscure capital allocation decisions or segment-specific funding requirements for investors. At the group level, Operating Free Cash Flow (OFCF) improved by 8.6% year-on-year to RM3,057 million in FY2024 [1, p.9], driven by improved working capital management and operational efficiencies. The QoQ dip in 4Q24 OFCF (RM431 million) was attributed to "higher regulatory related payments" [3, p.17], but rebounded strongly in 1Q25 to RM883 million [5, p.17]. CAPEX saw a significant reduction in FY2024 (down 17.0% to RM674 million) [1, p.9], reflecting a "prudent approach" and "strategic focus on essential investments" [1, p.9]. This disciplined CAPEX management contributes positively to OFCF. Maxis' CAPEX-to-service revenue ratio of 7.6% in FY2024 is notably lower than typical investment cycles for telcos in growth phases (often 15-20%), reflecting its "prudent approach" and focus on optimizing existing infrastructure rather than aggressive greenfield expansion, a strategic choice in a mature market or a response to regulatory changes.

#### Mobile Segment
*   **Key Achievements:**
    1.  **Strong 5G Adoption & Network Performance:** Maxis achieved 3.7 million 5G device subscriptions in 2024, a 50% YoY increase, with 5G penetration reaching 38% [1, p.27]. This reflects successful "inclusive and accessible 5G propositions" and effective traffic offload from 4G to 5G [1, p.27].
    2.  **Postpaid Subscriber Growth & Digital Self-Service:** The postpaid segment saw a 5.1% revenue increase in FY2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and pre-to-postpaid migrations [1, p.27]. Maxis also boasts an "all-time high" Net Promoter Score (TP-NPS) of +70 [1, p.28].
*   **Key Challenges:**
    1.  **Prepaid Revenue Decline & ARPU Pressure:** Prepaid revenue declined 2.1% in FY2024 [1, p.8], and Prepaid ARPU continued its downward trend, reaching RM34.3 in 1Q25 [4, p.20]. This indicates persistent competition and a shift towards more value-driven plans, significantly impacting profitability in this sub-segment. Management acknowledges focusing on "encouraging prepaid customers to transition to postpaid plans" [1, p.8]; however, the effectiveness and potential costs of this strategy in a competitive, price-sensitive market are critical unaddressed questions.
    2.  **Evolving 5G Landscape:** The "recent award of the second 5G network has presented new challenges" [1, p.7], introducing uncertainty and potential increased competition in the 5G wholesale market. Maxis' existing agreement with DNB ensures continued 5G services, but the long-term strategy in a dual network model remains in flux, requiring active engagement with stakeholders [1, p.7] and a clear plan to maintain its 5G competitive advantage.
*   **Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
    1.  **"Resilient Service Revenue" vs. Q1 2025 Decline:** While management states "Resilient Service Revenue in 1Q25" [4, p.4], the reported service revenue actually decreased by 0.9% YoY and 3.4% QoQ [4, p.4]. The explanation points to "changes in Maxis Device Care offering" and "reduced interconnect rates" [5, p.17], which affected revenue recognition. This highlights that "resilience" may refer to underlying demand, but reported figures show a contraction, requiring investors to look beyond the narrative.
    2.  **ARPU Stability Claims vs. Declining Trends:** The CEO's statement mentions "maintained a stable ARPU in the quarter" (referring to Q4 2024) [2, p.6]. However, the data shows a general downward trend in Consumer Postpaid ARPU (from RM75.1 in 1Q24 to RM71.8 in 1Q25) and Consumer Prepaid ARPU (from RM37.2 in 1Q24 to RM34.3 in 1Q25) [4, p.20]. While 4Q24 ARPU was stable QoQ, the overall trend over the past 5 quarters suggests ongoing ARPU pressure, which management appears to downplay, potentially masking deeper competitive or market structural issues.

#### Home Segment
*   **Key Achievements:**
    1.  **Consistent Revenue Growth & Expanding Fibre Footprint:** Home connectivity revenue grew by 7.4% in FY2024 to RM993 million [1, p.8] and further by 4.1% YoY in 1Q25 to RM254 million [5, p.17].
    2.  **Enhanced Service Reliability & Customer Experience:** Maxis improved service reliability, evidenced by reduced network complaints per 1,000 subscribers and widespread adoption of WiFi 6 routers [1, p.31].
*   **Key Challenges:**
    1.  **Highly Competitive Broadband Market:** Management acknowledges the "extremely competitive" broadband market [2, p.7]. This competitive pressure could increasingly impact future ARPU, connection growth, and margins, despite current strong ARPU.
    2.  **Infrastructure Expansion Costs:** Expanding fibre footprint requires significant, sustained investment. While overall CAPEX was reduced, continued infrastructure build-out is a mid-term priority [1, p.31], which could impact future free cash flow if not managed efficiently.
*   **Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
    1.  **"Strong ARPU" vs. Slight Fluctuations:** Management states "maintained strong ARPU" [2, p.7] for Home. While Home Connectivity ARPU has generally remained high (around RM109-110), it has seen slight fluctuations (e.g., dip from RM110.4 in 1Q24 to RM109.0 in 3Q24). This suggests that "strong" is relative, but not entirely stable, and could face downward pressure from aggressive competitor pricing.
    2.  **Emphasis on "Access to Premises" vs. Actual Penetration Rate:** Management highlights expanding fibre "access to over 7.8 million premises" [1, p.3], implying broad reach. However, the actual number of "Home Connections" (787,000 in 1Q25) represents a relatively low penetration rate of approximately 10% of premises passed. This suggests that converting broad network reach into higher customer penetration remains a significant challenge in the "extremely competitive broadband market" [2, p.7], a nuance that the emphasis on "access" might implicitly downplay. The low conversion rate indicates a critical hurdle in maximizing ROI on infrastructure investments.

#### Enterprise Segment
*   **Key Achievements:**
    1.  **Robust Revenue Growth & Diversified Offerings:** Enterprise revenue grew by 6.8% in FY2024 to RM1.61 billion [1, p.8], driven by increased mobile subscriptions and a significant 11.5% increase in Fixed & Solutions revenue [1, p.8].
    2.  **Leadership in Digital Transformation & AI Adoption:** Maxis became Malaysia's first telco to launch GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) in September 2024, enabling AI training for enterprises [1, p.33].
*   **Key Challenges:**
    1.  **Reliance on Non-Recurring Revenue:** The higher fixed & solutions revenue in 4Q24 was "driven by non-recurring charges from various project completions" [2, p.8], leading to a QoQ decline in 1Q25 [5, p.17]. This suggests potential revenue volatility if recurring service contracts are not consistently secured, making the segment's growth trajectory less predictable.
    2.  **Intensified Competition in New Growth Areas:** While Maxis is expanding into new areas like IoT, cloud, and AI, these markets are also highly competitive with specialized players. The "new business risk" and "competition risk" are explicitly acknowledged in the AR [1, p.22-23].
*   **Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
    1.  **"Strong Demand" vs. QoQ Dip:** Management indicated "strong demand for our digital solutions" [2, p.8] in 1Q25, but Enterprise revenue saw a 6.6% QoQ decrease from 4Q24 [5, p.17]. While explained by "higher non-recurring revenue" in the prior quarter, the statement could create an impression of continuous sequential growth that the numbers don't fully support, potentially overstating immediate momentum.
    2.  **"Leadership" in New Areas vs. Acknowledged "New Business Risk" and "Competition Risk":** Management strongly positions Maxis as a "leader" in new, high-growth areas like AI adoption and digital transformation [1, p.33]. However, the company's own risk disclosures explicitly highlight "new business risk" and "competition risk" when venturing into these very areas [1, p.22-23]. This creates a disconnect between the narrative of established leadership and the inherent challenges and uncertainties of operating in nascent, highly competitive markets with specialized players. True leadership will require consistent, high-value project wins and effective risk mitigation.
