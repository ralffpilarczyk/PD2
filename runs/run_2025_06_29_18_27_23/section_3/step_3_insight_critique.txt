This business analysis of Maxis Berhad's "Key Customers" offers a comprehensive overview, drawing on various public disclosures. It meticulously categorizes customer segments, details product offerings, and presents relevant metrics. However, an investigative critique reveals several areas where the analysis falls short in analytical depth, overlooks critical financial implications, and requires further probing to genuinely understand Maxis's customer dynamics and associated risks.

The analysis provides a broad descriptive landscape rather than a deeply interrogative one. While it correctly identifies Maxis's customer base and highlights key figures, it frequently defers to management's disclosed information without sufficiently questioning the completeness or implications of omitted data.

Here are the key areas for deeper analytical scrutiny:

### 1. The Critical Omission: Customer Churn Rates

**What:** The analysis notes Maxis's "all-time high TP-NPS of +70" and efforts to enhance customer experience, but explicitly states, "specific customer churn rates...are not explicitly disclosed in its public financial reports."

**Why:** Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures *satisfaction* and *willingness to recommend*, not *retention*. A high NPS can coexist with significant churn, especially in competitive markets where switching costs are low, or competitors offer compelling value. For a telecommunications provider, churn rates (broken down by postpaid/prepaid, mobile/home) are arguably the single most important metric for assessing customer loyalty, revenue stability, and the effectiveness of retention strategies. Their consistent absence from public disclosures raises a red flag. Is Maxis intentionally withholding this data because it's unfavorable, or less impressive than the NPS?

**So What:** Without churn rates, assessing the true "relationship strength and duration" is speculative. Investors cannot reliably gauge the stickiness of Maxis's customer base, the sustainability of subscriber growth, or the genuine impact of loyalty programs. This data gap significantly impairs an investor's ability to forecast future revenue stability and competitive resilience. A high NPS with high churn suggests a leaky bucket, where customer acquisition efforts merely offset departures.

### 2. Declining ARPU Amidst Rising Data Usage: A Red Flag

**What:** The analysis presents detailed tables showing Maxis's Mobile ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for both postpaid and prepaid segments declining from Q4 FY2024 to Q1 FY2025, even as data usage per customer increases. Home Blended ARPU remains relatively stable.

**Why:** This trend is a significant concern. Customers are consuming more data, yet paying less. This typically points to intense price competition, promotional activities (e.g., unlimited plans at lower price points), or customer down-tiering to cheaper plans. Maxis's shift towards "unlimited 5G data" for certain plans (MP109 and above) could be driving down ARPU on an overall basis if new subscribers or migrators opt for these potentially lower-priced unlimited options, or if higher data usage doesn't translate to higher revenue tiers. The analysis simply presents the numbers without exploring the 'why' behind this critical divergence.

| Metric                        | FY2024 (Q4) | 1Q25        | % Change (QoQ) |
| :---------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| Postpaid ARPU (RM)            | 74.5        | 71.8        | -3.62%         |
| Prepaid ARPU (RM)             | 36.5        | 34.3        | -6.03%         |
| Data Usage (GB/month) Postpaid | 33.8        | 35.0        | +3.55%         |
| Data Usage (GB/month) Prepaid | 29.5        | 31.9        | +8.14%         |
| Home Blended ARPU (RM)        | 109.2       | 110.1       | +0.82%         |

**So What:** Declining ARPU, despite volume growth, directly impacts revenue and, more critically, profit margins, especially in a capital-intensive industry like telecommunications. It suggests a deteriorating pricing environment or a shift towards lower-value customer segments, necessitating rigorous cost control to maintain profitability. This trend puts significant pressure on Maxis's ability to generate Free Cash Flow and indicates a highly competitive market where Maxis may be sacrificing revenue per user for subscriber growth.

### 3. Ambiguity in Enterprise Revenue Quality and Customer Concentration

**What:** The analysis notes Enterprise segment growth and provides revenue breakdown, but states, "Enterprise ARPU or total number of enterprise customers...are not explicitly disclosed." It also correctly highlights management's commentary about "non-recurring charges from project completions" influencing Enterprise fixed & solutions revenue.

**Why:** The lack of Enterprise ARPU and total customer count makes it impossible to understand the average value of an enterprise client or the distribution between large, high-value corporate clients and smaller SMEs. The explicit mention of "non-recurring" project revenue is a subtle but crucial admission. If a significant portion of Enterprise revenue growth is driven by one-off project completions rather than stable, recurring contracts (e.g., long-term connectivity, managed services), the quality and predictability of this revenue stream are diminished. The analysis doesn't quantify how much of Enterprise revenue is truly recurring versus project-based.

**So What:** This ambiguity hinders the assessment of the Enterprise segment's long-term sustainability and growth trajectory. Relying heavily on project-based revenue introduces volatility and requires a continuous pipeline of new, large projects to maintain growth. Investors typically prefer recurring, predictable revenue streams. Without more granularity on the enterprise customer base and the nature of their contracts, it's difficult to ascertain if Maxis is truly deepening relationships or simply executing a series of transactional engagements.

### 4. Impact of "SafeDevice Program" on Revenue Recognition: A Deeper Dive Needed

**What:** The original analysis briefly mentions the "new commercial arrangement for SafeDevice program" impacting Q1 2025 service revenue recognition, noting it did not affect EBITDA.

**Why:** This is a critical accounting nuance that demands further investigation. How did this program change revenue recognition? Did it reclassify revenue from service to non-service (e.g., device sales), or alter the timing of recognition for certain components? While EBITDA was unaffected, a decline in reported service revenue due to an accounting change can obscure underlying operational performance or competitive pressures. It's essential to understand the nature of the SafeDevice program and its specific impact on the financial statements beyond a mere mention.

**So What:** Changes in revenue recognition, even without impacting EBITDA, can misrepresent true underlying performance trends for key metrics like service revenue growth, which is closely watched by analysts. It requires a detailed reconciliation to ensure that a perceived decline in service revenue isn't just an accounting reclassification, and conversely, to ensure that the underlying operational trend isn't weaker than it appears post-adjustment.

### Conclusion

While the analysis successfully structures and presents Maxis's customer information, its "investigative thinking" needs to be more robust. It acts more as a reporter of disclosed facts than a skeptical analyst. The most material analytical insights missing revolve around **customer churn rates**, the reasons behind the **declining ARPU despite increasing data usage**, and the **quality/predictability of enterprise revenue**. By delving into these areas, leveraging the "What-Why-So What" framework, and demanding more granular data or plausible explanations for trends and omissions, the analysis could move from descriptive to truly insightful, providing a more balanced and critical perspective for investment decision-making.
