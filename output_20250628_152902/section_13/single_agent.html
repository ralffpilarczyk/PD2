                </li>
                <li><strong>Competitive and Historical Context:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This strategy is an "early success" of a transformation initiated in FY2023, resulting in a sharp improvement in the core manufacturing segment in FY2024 after more than a decade. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 4, Chairman's Message)</li>
                        <li>Higher order volumes from existing customers and new project wins (biomedical, consumer, medical devices, drone technology, smart appliances) in FY2024 validate this focus. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 4-5, Chairman's Message)</li>
                        <li>The Group is positioned as a trusted manufacturing partner for innovative, high-performance products, with projects involving high-precision tooling expected to translate into long-term sustainable revenue due to their "sticky" nature. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5, Chairman's Message)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Competitive and Historical Context:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amid geopolitical uncertainty, more customers seek to source production away from China. Fu Yu's Singapore headquarters and presence in three countries allow it to offer this flexibility. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5, Chairman's Message)</li>

        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>c. Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies</h3>
    <p>While Fu Yu Corporation Limited articulates clear strategic objectives and implements corporate strategies, one notable disconnect emerged during FY2024 relating to its now-discontinued supply chain management services segment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Discontinued Supply Chain Management Services (Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd - FYSCS)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective (Implicit/Former Aspiration):</strong> To operate a successful and well-managed supply chain management services segment as part of the Group's diverse business portfolio, contributing to overall revenue and profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate Strategy (Former):</strong> To engage in providing supply chain management services for commodity raw materials, including sourcing, shipping, and supplying commodities within the Group and to external customers. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 18, Sustainability Report - Our Business)</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnect:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Despite being a significant contributor to overall revenue (39.9% of total revenue in FY2024, Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 29, Review of Performance), the Group ceased all business activities in FYSCS in the last quarter of FY2024. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5, Chairman's Message; Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 11, Note 1)</li>
                        <li>The cessation was explicitly due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" and "significant weaknesses in FYSCS's risk management process" highlighted by an internal audit report dated 26 July 2024. (Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 26, Note 15; Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5, Chairman's Message; p. 162, Corporate Governance Report - Principle 9)</li>
                        <li>Ongoing investigations into the affairs of FYSCS, including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email accounts," and "irregular expense claims," leading to potential claims against individuals, indicate a severe breakdown in governance and operational control within this segment. (Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 26-27, Note 32; Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 101, Directors' Statement)</li>
                        <li>The external auditor issued a qualified opinion on the FY2024 financial statements due to the ongoing investigation into FYSCS, unable to determine the potential financial impact. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 104, Independent Auditor's Report)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Impact of Disconnect:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This represents a significant disconnect where a business segment, while contributing to topline revenue, failed to meet operational, governance, and management expectations, leading to its complete discontinuation and resource reallocation. This undermines the implicit strategic objective of maintaining a diversified and profitably managed portfolio segment.</li>
                        <li>Resources previously allocated to FYSCS are now being reallocated to the core manufacturing business to sharpen focus. (Fu Yu 24 AR, p. 5, Chairman's Message; Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 30, Commentary)</li>
                    </ul>
