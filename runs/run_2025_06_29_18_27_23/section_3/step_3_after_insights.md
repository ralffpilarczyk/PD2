## SECTION 3: Key Customers

Maxis Berhad, a leading integrated telecommunications provider in Malaysia, serves diverse Consumer and Enterprise divisions, focusing on enhancing connectivity, delivering innovative solutions, and improving customer experience.

### a. List of Largest Customers

Maxis does not explicitly name individual "largest customers" in public disclosures, which is common for telecommunications companies due to the vast number of subscribers. Instead, it segments its customer base into broad categories:

*   **Consumer Segment:** This represents the largest portion of Maxis's customer base, encompassing individual mobile subscribers (postpaid and prepaid) and home connectivity users. Mobile Revenue Generating Subscribers (RGS): 10.56 million (Q1 2025). Home Connections: 787,000 (Q1 2025).
*   **Enterprise Segment:** This segment serves businesses across various sizes, from corporates and mid-market to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the public sector. The company highlights partnerships with global cloud providers (e.g., AWS), managed SD-WAN networks for investment banks, the Maxis 5G Alliance (75 members by FY2024), and SMEs through government initiatives.
*   **Wholesale Customers/Partners:** This includes other mobile network operators (MNOs) to whom Maxis provides 2G and 4G wholesale services. Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) is a significant wholesale network provider *to* Maxis for 5G services, making Maxis a customer of DNB, but also a potential future partner in a dual 5G network model.
*   **Related Parties as Customers/Partners:** Maxis has material transactions with related parties, including MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems (Astro) for content co-marketing, Saudi Telecom Company (STC) for roaming, and Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) for 5G products and services (where Maxis is both a customer and a shareholder/potential network operator).

### b. Position in the Value Chain

Maxis operates as a **Tier 1 service provider** directly to end-consumers (B2C: mobile, home internet, digital lifestyle) and businesses (B2B: integrated telecommunications and ICT solutions like connectivity, IoT, cloud, AI, and cybersecurity). It also functions as a **Tier 1 supplier** for 2G and 4G wholesale services to other MNOs. The transition to a dual 5G network model could shift Maxis's position from solely a 5G wholesale customer to a network operator in the 5G wholesale value chain.

### c. Relationship Strength and Duration

Maxis emphasizes strong customer satisfaction, evidenced by an All-time high TP-NPS (Total Net Promoter Score) of **+70** in FY2024 and industry awards for customer experience. However, a critical omission from its public disclosures is **specific customer churn rates** (e.g., monthly postpaid or prepaid churn). This data gap is significant because NPS measures *satisfaction* and *recommendation likelihood*, not actual *retention*. A high NPS can coexist with substantial churn, especially in competitive markets where switching costs are low. Without churn rates, the true "relationship strength and duration" remains speculative, impairing a reliable assessment of customer stickiness, revenue stability, and the genuine impact of loyalty programs. This absence significantly limits an investor's ability to forecast future subscriber growth and competitive resilience.

### d. Products Purchased by Each Key Customer and Associated Metrics

Maxis's product offerings are categorized by its core business segments:

**1. Consumer Mobile**
*   **Products:** Postpaid plans (unlimited 5G data for MP109+), Hotlink Postpaid (50-150GB 5G), Hotlink Prepaid (RM40 Unlimited 5G Data, RM25 for 30GB+30GB 5G). Device ownership programs like Maxis Zerolution and Trade-In Programme.
*   **Metrics & Critical Insight:**
    The detailed metrics below reveal a significant concern: **Mobile ARPU for both postpaid and prepaid segments declined from Q4 FY2024 to Q1 FY2025, even as data usage per customer increased.**
    | Metric                      | FY2024 (Q4) | 1Q25  | % Change (QoQ) |
    |:----------------------------|:------------|:------|:---------------|
    | Postpaid ARPU (RM)          | 74.5        | 71.8  | -3.62%         |
    | Prepaid ARPU (RM)           | 36.5        | 34.3  | -6.03%         |
    | Data Usage (GB/month) Postpaid | 33.8        | 35.0  | +3.55%         |
    | Data Usage (GB/month) Prepaid  | 29.5        | 31.9  | +8.14%         |
    This trend directly impacts revenue and profit margins, suggesting Maxis may be sacrificing revenue per user for subscriber growth in a highly competitive environment, necessitating rigorous cost control to maintain profitability and Free Cash Flow.

**2. Consumer Home**
*   **Products:** Maxis Fibre, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) with 5G, Max WiFi, and Maxis Home Solar.
*   **Metrics:** Home Connections: 787,000 (Q1 2025). Home Blended ARPU: RM110.1 (Q1 2025).

**3. Enterprise**
*   **Products:** Connectivity (mobile, fibre), IoT, Cloud (Maxis Business Cloud, GPU-as-a-Service, AWS partnership), AI, Cybersecurity, SD-WAN.
*   **Metrics & Critical Insight:** Supports 20,000 SMEs (FY2024). Enterprise Mobile Revenue: RM213 million (Q1 2025). Enterprise Fixed & Solutions Revenue: RM185 million (Q1 2025). Maxis 5G Alliance: 75 members.
    Despite reported growth, the absence of Enterprise ARPU or total enterprise customer counts (beyond specific initiatives) creates ambiguity. Management's comments on "non-recurring charges from project completions" (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 8; Maxis 25Q1 TS, slide 8) suggest that a portion of Enterprise revenue growth may be project-based rather than stable, recurring contracts. This introduces volatility and reduces revenue predictability, warranting close monitoring of the recurring service revenue pipeline.

### e. Customer Segmentation by Industry and Geography

*   **Industry:** Consumer (individuals/households) and Enterprise (corporates, mid-market businesses, SMEs, public sector, and other mobile network operators).
*   **Geography:** Predominantly **Malaysia**, with revenue also generated from roaming business in other countries (RM220 million in FY2024).

### f. Customer Positioning (Premium, Mid-market, Value Segments)

Maxis employs a strategic dual-brand approach: **Maxis Postpaid** targets premium users with unlimited 5G data and enhanced features. **Hotlink** (both postpaid and prepaid) targets value segments like budget-conscious users and students with affordable, data-rich plans. Enterprise solutions are tailored to various business sizes, implying a tiered approach to service and pricing.

### g. Revenue Contribution and Customer Concentration

Maxis's revenue is primarily driven by its Consumer and Enterprise segments, indicating diversification across a large customer base. The **Consumer segment consistently contributes the majority of service revenue** (e.g., ~81.8% in FY2024). While the Enterprise segment shows robust growth, it remains smaller than the Consumer segment. No significant customer concentration risk with any single named customer is apparent. Related party transactions, while material, are relatively small compared to Maxis's total revenue (e.g., RM90 million sales to MEASAT vs. RM10.54 billion total revenue in FY2024), suggesting no undue concentration.

**Critical Stance:** Management's Q4 2024 commentary stating "total subscribers by 2.4% year-on-year to 9.7 billion subscribers" (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 6) is an obvious typo, as official reports clearly show total RGS in the millions (e.g., 10.488 million in AR 2024). This highlights the importance of data verification.

### h. Purchase Patterns and Contract Terms

*   **Mobile:** Maxis actively encourages prepaid customers to transition to postpaid plans, recognizing postpaid as a more stable revenue stream, driving significant postpaid subscriber growth (+7.9% YoY in FY2024). Device bundling with flexible installments (Maxis Zerolution, up to 36 months) enhances stickiness. Prepaid revenue saw a marginal decrease.
*   **Home Connectivity:** Focus on expanding fibre and enhancing bundled propositions (e.g., Maxis Home Solar). Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) offers flexible contracts.
*   **Enterprise:** Shift towards diversifying service offerings beyond traditional mobile to fixed and digital solutions. Enterprise fixed & solutions revenue can be influenced by non-recurring project charges.
*   **Wholesale (DNB):** The agreement with DNB involves conditional share subscription and prepayment for 5G services, signaling long-term engagement in the 5G wholesale market, with terms for potential equity restructuring and dual 5G network operation.

**Critical Insight:** The "new commercial arrangement for SafeDevice program" impacted Q1 2025 service revenue recognition (Maxis 25Q1 TS, slide 4). While management indicated no impact on EBITDA, this accounting change is crucial. It suggests a reclassification of revenue or altered timing of recognition, which can obscure underlying operational performance trends for reported service revenue. A detailed reconciliation would be necessary to ascertain if perceived declines are purely accounting adjustments, or if they mask competitive pressures or shifts in business models.
