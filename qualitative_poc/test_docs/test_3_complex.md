# Strategic Review

## Market Position
Despite our strong brand and market leadership, commoditization has eliminated our pricing power. The entire industry has become undifferentiated, with customers making decisions purely on price.

## Growth Strategy  
We are expanding internationally to find new growth opportunities. Our expansion into emerging markets is progressing well, with several new markets already entered this year.

## Competitive Dynamics
Our platform benefits from significant network effects, where each additional user increases value for all participants. However, regulation continues to limit our ability to monetize these advantages.
