**One-Time Items and Adjustments:**
*   **FY2024:**
    *   Goodwill impairment of S$3.286 million (FS p.5, 10, 12; AR p.115, 119) related to the discontinued Supply Chain Management Services (SCS) segment.
    *   Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) impairment of S$0.579 million for a subsidiary in China (FS p.4, 10, 12; AR p.115, 119).
    *   Discontinuation of the entire SCS segment in Q4 2024 (FS p.15).
*   **FY2023:**
    *   Goodwill impairment of S$2.678 million (FS p.10, 12, 15; AR p.115, 119).
    *   Loss on liquidation of a subsidiary of S$0.432 million (AR p.109, 119).
    *   Reversal of impairment loss on investments in subsidiaries amounting to S$3.825 million (AR p.115).

#### Key Recent Trends

*   **Revenue Volatility & Strategic Shift:** Consolidated revenue remained relatively flat in FY2024 (+0.5%) after a significant decline of 20.7% from FY2022 to FY2023. This masks underlying changes: the core Manufacturing segment's revenue increased by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, driven by strong growth in Singapore (+20.9%) and Malaysia (+24.9%), while China operations declined by 11.8%. The Supply Chain Management Services (SCS) segment, now discontinued, saw its revenue decrease by 11.6% in FY2024. This indicates a strategic re-focus towards higher-margin manufacturing activities.
    *   *Source: AR p.5, 8, 9, FS p.4, 20, 32.*
*   **Profitability Turnaround (Continuing Operations):** The net loss from continuing operations narrowed significantly from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024. Consolidated EBITDA and Operating Income showed a positive trend, improving from substantial losses in FY2023 to positive EBITDA and reduced operating losses in FY2024. This highlights operational improvements in the core business.
    *   *Source: AR p.5, 8, 109, FS p.4.*
*   **Interim Period Dynamics:** 1H2024 showed a substantial 78.0% increase in revenue and a positive net income of S$0.1 million, significantly boosted by the SCS segment's performance prior to its cessation. Conversely, 2H2024 revenue sharply declined by 45.8% due to the discontinuation of SCS activities, leading to a larger net loss for the period. This illustrates the distorting effect of the discontinued segment on consolidated performance.

#### Margin Analysis

| Metric                         | FY2024   | FY2023   | FY2022   |
| :----------------------------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| Consolidated Net Income Margin | -2.04%   | -5.31%   | 6.08%    |
| Consolidated EBITDA Margin     | 4.91%    | 0.35%    | N/A      |
| Consolidated Operating Income Margin | -1.21%   | -5.08%   | N/A      |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin | 13.5%    | 11.7%    | N/A      |
| Consolidated Gross Profit Margin | 8.9%     | 7.0%     | N/A      |

*   **Overall Margin Improvement:** The Group's consolidated gross profit margin improved from 7.0% in FY2023 to 8.9% in FY2024, outpacing the slight revenue growth. This improvement was largely driven by the manufacturing segment, which saw its gross profit margin increase from 11.7% to 13.5%. This uplift is attributed by management to strategic transformation, advanced tooling, and new product introduction (NPI) initiatives.
    *   *Source: AR p.5, 8.*
*   **EBITDA Turnaround:** Consolidated EBITDA margin significantly improved from a marginal 0.35% in FY2023 to a more robust 4.91% in FY2024. This positive shift is indicative of enhanced operational efficiency and effective cost-containment measures, notably a 20.4% reduction in selling and administrative expenses.
    *   *Source: AR p.8, FS p.4.*
*   **Persistent Losses:** Despite the notable improvements in gross profit and EBITDA margins, the Group remained in a consolidated net loss position for FY2024. The negative consolidated operating income margin indicates that, even before accounting for finance costs and taxes, the overall operations were not consistently profitable, weighed down by the losses from the discontinued segment and non-recurring charges.
    *   *Source: FS p.4.*

#### Cash Flow Assessment

*   **Positive Operating Cash Flow:** A crucial achievement for FY2024 is the return to positive net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million, a significant reversal from the S$4.5 million outflow in FY2023. This improvement in cash generation is attributed to a lower pre-tax loss and effective management of working capital, including decreases in inventories and trade receivables.
    *   *Source: AR p.5, 9, 119.*
*   **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Capital expenditure (Capex) increased notably to S$6.9 million in FY2024 (from S$4.0 million in FY2023). This increased investment is primarily directed towards the purchase of factory equipment, plant, and machinery, supporting the ongoing strategic enhancement of manufacturing capabilities, particularly at the Smart Factory in Singapore.
    *   *Source: AR p.9, 119, FS p.10.*
*   **Cash Conversion (as per prompt formula):** As per the specific formula provided in the requirements `EBITDA / (EBITDA/Capex)`, the result simplifies to `Capex`. Therefore, the cash conversion value according to this formula is S$6,940k for FY2024 and S$3,962k for FY2023.
*   **Liquidity Position:** The Group maintained a sound net cash position of S$55.5 million as at 31 December 2024, a slight decrease from S$60.3 million in FY2023. This reduction is primarily a result of the increased capital expenditures and investments made during the year, indicating a strategic deployment of cash towards operational improvements and growth initiatives.

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**Two Key Achievements:**

1.  **Successful Strategic Transformation of Core Manufacturing:** Fu Yu has effectively advanced its strategic transformation, leading to a demonstrable improvement in the core manufacturing segment's performance. Gross profit from manufacturing operations significantly increased by 28.1%, with its gross profit margin improving from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024. This was driven by new project wins, investment in advanced tooling, and the establishment of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team, validating the effectiveness of their strategy to focus on high-precision manufacturing.
    *   *Source: AR p.5, 8 (Chairman's Message, Financial Highlights).*
2.  **Robust Turnaround in Operating Cash Flow:** The Group achieved a critical milestone by reversing a substantial negative operating cash flow, converting an outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 into a net inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024. This improvement indicates enhanced working capital management and operational efficiency, providing crucial internal funding for ongoing investments and future growth without relying on external financing.
    *   *Source: AR p.5, 9 (Chairman's Message, Financial Position).*

**Two Key Challenges:**

1.  **Persistent Consolidated Losses and Impact of Discontinued Operations:** Despite the positive strides in the manufacturing segment, the Group still recorded an overall consolidated net loss of S$3.9 million for FY2024. The full financial impact of discontinuing the Supply Chain Management Services (SCS) segment, which contributed significantly to losses and revenue volatility, will only be fully realized in future periods. The substantial goodwill impairment (S$3.286 million in FY2024) associated with the SCS segment highlights a past strategic misstep that continues to weigh on the Group’s overall financial health and requires careful management during the transition.

2.  **Navigating Geopolitical and Economic Headwinds:** Management explicitly acknowledges a "challenging operating landscape" and "geopolitical uncertainty" impacting global supply chains and raw material costs. The decline in the China manufacturing segment's revenue contribution (-11.8%) demonstrates the direct impact of these external factors. This necessitates a continued rebalancing of geographical revenue and ongoing adaptation of strategies, particularly as "more customers seek to source production away from China."

**Two Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**

1.  **Optimistic Framing vs. Consolidated Financial Reality:** The Chairman's message asserts a "sharp improvement" in the core manufacturing segment and declares the Group "clearly on a growth trajectory." While the *continuing manufacturing operations* did show significant recovery (narrowing net loss from S$7.6 million to S$1.2 million), the *consolidated* revenue growth for the entire Group was minimal (+0.5% for FY2024 vs. FY2023), and the Group remained in a consolidated net loss position of S$3.9 million. This narrative appears to selectively emphasize positive aspects of the manufacturing segment while downplaying the broader, less favorable consolidated top-line stagnation and bottom-line losses, which are significantly impacted by the issues and discontinuation of the SCS segment.
    *   *Source: AR p.5 (Chairman's Message), AR p.8 (Financial Highlights), FS p.4 (B(i)).*
2.  **Understated Systemic Risk of Internal Control Weaknesses:** The Directors' Statement reveals a "qualified opinion" from external auditors due to an "ongoing investigation into the affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd" and "significant weaknesses" in its risk management process (AR p.100, 104). While management claims these investigations are "isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations" (AR p.6), the qualified audit opinion inherently compromises the reliability of the *consolidated* financial statements. The presence of such fundamental internal control failures and the inability of auditors to conclude on their financial impact pose a broader systemic risk, including reputational damage, potential legal liabilities, and impact on investor confidence, which management's compartmentalization of the issue may understate.
