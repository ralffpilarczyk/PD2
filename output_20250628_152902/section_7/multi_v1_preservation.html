### Key Recent Trends

*   **Revenue:** Total Group Revenue increased marginally by 0.47% in FY2024, rising from S$190.4 million to S$191.3 million [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8, page 29]. This masks a significant shift in revenue composition: Continuing Operations revenue grew robustly by 10.53%, from S$103.9 million to S$114.9 million, while Revenue from Discontinued Operations declined by 11.62%, from S$86.4 million to S$76.4 million [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109, page 138], indicating a strategic shift or divestment impacting the top line.
*   **Profitability & Margins:**
    *   **Gross Profit (Continuing Operations):** Improved significantly by 27.52% from S$12.2 million in FY2023 to S$15.5 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109]. Consequently, the Gross Profit Margin from Continuing Operations increased from 11.7% to 13.5% [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8].
    *   **EBITDA (Continuing Operations):** Remarkably recovered, surging over 13-fold from S$0.6 million in FY2023 to S$8.5 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8]. The EBITDA margin for continuing operations jumped from a low 0.58% to 7.40%.
    *   **Operating Income (Continuing Operations):** Turned positive, shifting from a loss of S$(7.4) million in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.46 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109]. The operating income margin similarly improved from -7.13% to 0.40%.
    *   **Net Income:** Despite improvements in continuing operations, the company still reported a net loss for the year, though significantly reduced from S$(10.1) million in FY2023 to S$(4.5) million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109]. The Total Basic Loss Per Share decreased from (1.34) cents to (0.59) cents [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109], and the Net Income Margin improved from -5.31% to -2.34%.
*   **Cash Flow Generation:**
    *   **Operating Activities:** The company transitioned from using cash in operating activities (S$(4.5) million in FY2023) to generating S$3.6 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 112]. This strong positive trend indicates improved operational efficiency and working capital management.
    *   **Investing Activities:** Cash usage in investing activities significantly increased, from S$(2.0) million in FY2023 to S$(5.1) million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 112]. This suggests increased capital expenditure or other investments. The capex proxy as a percentage of revenue increased from 1.07% to 2.66%.
    *   **Financing Activities:** The company shifted from using S$(7.9) million in financing activities in FY2023 to generating S$0.27 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 112]. Primarily, this is due to a substantial reduction in current loans and borrowings from S$4,206 thousand in FY2023 to S$1,078 thousand in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 108].
    *   **Overall Cash Position:** Despite the positive operating cash flow, the net effect of all activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of S$(1.2) million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 112], an improvement from a S$(14.4) million decrease in FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 112]. Cash and bank balances slightly decreased from S$60.3 million to S$55.5 million [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 108].

### Performance Assessment

**Key Drivers of Performance:**

The primary driver for the improved financial performance in FY2024 is the strong recovery and growth within the Continuing Operations segment. This segment saw significant revenue growth, coupled with even more substantial improvements in gross profit, EBITDA, and operating income, indicating better operational efficiency, cost management, or favorable market conditions for its core continuing businesses.

Conversely, the Discontinued Operations segment continues to be a drag, with declining revenue and contributing to the overall net loss. The substantial goodwill write-off (from S$3,185 thousand in FY2023 to S$0 thousand in FY2024) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 108] occurred due to these struggling discontinued operations, highlighting both asset impairment and strategic divestment. While the goodwill write-off directly impacts the balance sheet, its recognition as an impairment loss on the income statement (contributing to the Loss from discontinued operations) was a significant one-time event influencing the reported net loss.

The transition to positive operating cash flow in FY2024 is a vital improvement, suggesting that the company's core operations are becoming more self-sustaining from a cash perspective. However, increased investing activities consumed a significant portion of this cash, leading to a slight overall decrease in cash balances. The reduction in current borrowings also helped improve the liquidity profile.

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**Key Achievements (FY2024 vs FY2023):**

1.  **Strong Turnaround in Continuing Operations Profitability:** The most significant achievement is the remarkable recovery in the profitability of the continuing operations. The segment transitioned from a substantial operating loss of S$(7.4) million in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.46 million in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109]. This was driven by a 27.52% increase in Gross Profit and a massive 13-fold surge in EBITDA from continuing operations [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8, page 109], indicating successful efforts in enhancing efficiency and managing costs within its core business.
2.  **Positive Operating Cash Flow Generation:** Fu Yu successfully reversed its operating cash flow trend, moving from a net cash usage of S$(4.5) million in FY2023 to generating S$3.6 million in FY2024 from operating activities [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 112]. This is crucial for financial health, demonstrating the company's ability to generate cash internally from its business operations and reduce reliance on external financing.

**Key Challenges (FY2024 vs FY2023):**

1.  **Persistent Overall Net Loss and Drag from Discontinued Operations:** Despite the significant improvements in continuing operations, the company still reported a net loss of S$(4.5) million for FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109]. A major contributor to this continued loss is the Discontinued Operations segment, which saw a decline in revenue and reported an increased loss of S$(3.3) million in FY2024 compared to S$(2.5) million in FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109, page 138]. The persistent underperformance of this segment remains a significant financial burden.
2.  **Asset Impairment and Balance Sheet Contraction:** The complete write-off of Goodwill, reducing it from S$3,185 thousand in FY2023 to S$0 thousand in FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 108], reflects a significant asset impairment. This contributes to the overall decline in Total Assets by 1.35% and a decrease in Shareholders' Equity by 0.93% [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 108], which indicates a shrinking asset base and capital.

**Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance (based on typical financial reporting emphasis):**

1.  **Gearing Ratio vs. Net Cash Position:** The company explicitly states "Gearing Ratio (FY2024): Net Cash" and "Gearing Ratio (FY2023): Net Cash" [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8]. This implies the company has more cash than debt, indicating a net cash position (calculated as S$48.3 million in FY2024 and S$51.1 million in FY2023). However, the report also provides specific Gearing Ratios of 22.8% for FY2024 and 22.9% for FY2023 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 116]. These positive gearing percentages typically indicate a net debt position or a significant level of gross debt relative to equity. This discrepancy may arise from different definitions of "gearing" (e.g., gross debt to equity vs. net debt to equity) or different equity bases (Shareholders' Equity vs. "Net equity" of S$164,700 thousand [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 116]), creating confusion regarding the company's true leverage and liquidity profile.
2.  **Total Group Revenue Stability Amidst Strategic Shifts:** While Total Group Revenue remained stable (0.47% increase) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 8, page 29], this masks a significant underlying strategic move. The strong growth in "Continuing Operations" revenue (10.53%) was almost entirely offset by a substantial decline in "Discontinued Operations" revenue (-11.62%) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 109, page 138]. Presenting the overall revenue stability without adequately highlighting the rebalancing act between continuing and discontinued segments could understate the operational improvements in the core business and the challenges faced by the divested/phasing-out operations. The sustained overall net loss underscores that the positive developments in continuing operations have not yet fully compensated for the strategic restructuring and past underperformance.
