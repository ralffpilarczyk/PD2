<h4>Drivers of Performance:</h4>
<p>The overall 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue for FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup> was driven by strong performance in Malaysia and Singapore, which compensated for a decline in China. Malaysia's manufacturing revenue significantly increased by 39.1% in 1H2024 <sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.5]</sup>, indicating robust demand or successful market penetration in that region. Singapore manufacturing also saw positive growth of 6.6% in 1H2024 <sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.5]</sup>, likely bolstered by the strategic investments in the Smart Factory and the launch of Fu Yu Biomedical in 2023 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.3]</sup>, attracting new high-precision projects. Conversely, China's manufacturing revenue declined by 20.4% in 1H2024 <sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.5]</sup>, suggesting challenging market conditions or a shift in focus away from that region. The substantial increase in 2H2024 manufacturing revenue compared to 1H2024 (S$60.1 million vs S$54.8 million) indicates strong momentum towards the end of the year.</p>

<h4>Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:</h4>
<p>The positive trend in overall manufacturing revenue, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, appears sustainable given the company's strategic shift towards high-precision and MedTech segments (e.g., Fu Yu Biomedical launched in 2023 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.3]</sup>, new projects with international biomedical companies and CDMOs in 1H2024 <sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.11]</sup>). The increased order book <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6]</sup> further supports future revenue growth. However, the continued decline in China could be a drag if not managed effectively, but its relative contribution has decreased (27.9% of total manufacturing revenue in FY2024) <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>.</p>

<h4>Quantified Financial Impact:</h4>
<p>The 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue to S$114.9 million in FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup> was the primary driver of the Group's overall 0.5% revenue increase to S$191.3 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup>, especially as the supply chain management services segment declined to S$76.4 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup>. This growth in the higher-margin manufacturing segment also contributed significantly to the 27.5% increase in gross profit from continuing operations to S$15.5 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>.</p>

<h4>Due Diligence Questions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>What is the underlying demand driver for the significant growth in Malaysia's manufacturing revenue in 1H2024, and what steps are being taken to mitigate the continued decline in China's manufacturing revenue?</li>
    <li>Can the company provide a breakdown of manufacturing revenue by end-market (e.g., medical, consumer electronics, automotive) to assess diversification and exposure to growth sectors, particularly regarding the contribution from new biomedical projects?</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Gross Profit Margin (Segmental)</h3>

<h4>Definition and Relevance:</h4>
<p>Gross Profit Margin (GPM) represents the percentage of revenue left after deducting the cost of goods sold. Analyzing GPM by segment (manufacturing vs. supply chain management services) reveals the profitability of each core business line and the Company's ability to manage production costs, optimize pricing, and enhance operational efficiency. It's a direct indicator of "unit margins" and overall unit economics.</p>

<h4>Historical Data (Last 24 months):</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>FY2024 Overall GPM:</strong> 8.9%, up from 7.0% in FY2023 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup>.
    <ul>
        <li>Manufacturing Segment GPM (FY2024): 13.5%, up from 11.7% in FY2023 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>.</li>
        <li>Supply Chain Management Services Segment GPM (FY2024): 1.9% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>1H2024 Overall GPM:</strong> 6.7% <sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.6]</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>2H2024 Overall GPM:</strong> 13.2% <sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.29]</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>FY2023 Overall GPM:</strong> 7.0% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup>.
    <ul>
        <li>Manufacturing Segment GPM (FY2023): 11.7% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Benchmarking:</h4>
<p>No explicit competitor or industry average data is available in the provided facts for benchmarking.</p>

<h4>Drivers of Performance:</h4>
<p>The significant improvement in overall gross profit margin from 7.0% in FY2023 to 8.9% in FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup> was primarily driven by the manufacturing segment, which saw its GPM improve from 11.7% to 13.5% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>. This improvement suggests better cost control, potentially higher value-added projects, or improved pricing power. The supply chain management services segment, while contributing to overall revenue, maintained a very low GPM of 1.9% in FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.8]</sup>, indicating its low-margin nature. The GPM trajectory within FY2024 shows a strong recovery in 2H2024 (13.2%) compared to 1H2024 (6.7%) <sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.29, Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.6]</sup>, which could be due to a more favorable product mix, successful cost-reduction initiatives, or increased utilization in the latter half of the year. The Company's efforts to increase automation <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7]</sup> and improve operational efficiency by replacing hydraulic machinery <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.47]</sup> likely contribute to this margin expansion.</p>

<h4>Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:</h4>
<p>The positive trend in manufacturing GPM is likely sustainable, supported by the ongoing strategic shift towards high-precision and MedTech products, which typically command higher margins <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.3, p.7]</sup>. Further improvements are expected from increased automation levels and efficiency initiatives <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7, p.47]</sup>. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform completed most of its testing in FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7]</sup> and recent transition to a paperless mould-making platform <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.47]</sup> should further enhance operational efficiency and cost management, supporting margin expansion.</p>

<h4>Quantified Financial Impact:</h4>
<p>The increase in manufacturing GPM from 11.7% to 13.5% in FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>, coupled with the 10.5% revenue growth in that segment, significantly contributed to the 27.5% increase in gross profit for continuing operations to S$15.5 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>. This margin expansion was crucial in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations to S$1.2 million from S$7.6 million in FY2024 <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5]</sup>, and reversing the Singapore manufacturing operations PBT from a loss of S$6.9 million to a profit of S$1.2 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.29]</sup>. The 2H2024 GPM improvement to 13.2% from 1H2024's 6.7% contributed to the Group's net loss narrowing to S$3.964 million in 2H24 <sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.4]</sup> from a net profit of S$0.1 million in 1H2024 <sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.6]</sup>.</p>

<h4>Due Diligence Questions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>What specific initiatives (e.g., pricing strategy, product mix shift, cost efficiencies) primarily drove the substantial GPM improvement in 2H2024, and what are the detailed assumptions for maintaining or improving this trend in FY2025?</li>
    <li>Given the low margin of the supply chain management services segment (1.9% in FY2024), what is the long-term strategy for this segment, and how does it contribute to the overall manufacturing business (e.g., customer stickiness, integrated solutions)?</li>
</ol>
