ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
-   **Prioritize Diagnostic and Prescriptive Insights:** Focus on generating insights that identify root causes, quantify their impact, and lead directly to actionable recommendations, rather than merely descriptive summaries of data.
-   **Employ Structured Frameworks for Causal Discovery:** Utilize analytical frameworks (e.g., process flow analysis, bottleneck identification, comparative benchmarking, cause-and-effect diagrams) to systematically uncover interdependencies and reveal the 'why' behind operational performance metrics.
-   **Quantify the 'So What':** Systematically translate analytical findings into their tangible business implications, such as cost savings, efficiency gains, risk reductions, or revenue opportunities, to demonstrate value.
-   **Leverage Comparative Analysis:** Always seek opportunities to compare current performance against benchmarks (industry best practices, historical data, or internal targets) to highlight areas of excellence and identify significant gaps or improvement potential.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
-   **Conduct Rigorous Upfront Scoping:** Before drafting, establish a comprehensive understanding of the analysis's scope, required data sources, key stakeholders, and the desired depth of insight to prevent critical omissions and ensure completeness.
-   **Adopt a Hypothesis-Driven Approach Early:** Begin the analysis with clear hypotheses or guiding questions to direct data collection and analysis, ensuring focus on key areas and preventing a purely descriptive initial draft.
-   **Integrate 'So What' Early in the Drafting Process:** Do not defer insight generation; from the earliest draft, challenge findings with "So what does this mean?" and "What are the implications?" to push for deeper analysis and avoid superficial observations.
-   **Define Analytical Depth Expectations:** Clearly articulate the desired level of analytical depth (e.g., descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) at the outset, guiding the research and preventing a superficial initial attempt.
-   **Seek Early Stakeholder or Peer Feedback:** Implement an early review mechanism to identify missing perspectives, data gaps, or misinterpretations before significant effort is invested in a potentially incomplete or misdirected analysis.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
-   **Focus on Process-Centric Analysis for Operations:** For operational sections, prioritize mapping and analyzing specific processes, identifying bottlenecks, and measuring key metrics like cycle time, throughput, and resource utilization to pinpoint precise areas for intervention.
-   **Translate Operational Findings to Financial Impact:** Ensure that all operational inefficiencies or successes are clearly linked to their quantifiable financial implications (e.g., wasted costs, lost revenue, savings potential) to demonstrate business value.
-   **Address Interdependencies Beyond the Immediate Process:** Proactively consider the broader system by identifying how operational changes impact other departments, technologies, or human factors (e.g., training needs, culture, change management) to ensure holistic and sustainable solutions.
-   **Prioritize Root Cause and Leverage Point Identification:** Dive deep to identify the fundamental causes of operational issues and pinpoint high-leverage intervention points that offer the greatest impact on performance with feasible effort.
-   **Provide Actionable, Measurable Recommendations:** Conclude operational analysis with specific, implementable recommendations accompanied by clear, measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for tracking post-implementation success.
