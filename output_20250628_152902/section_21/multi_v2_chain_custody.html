<p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited possesses three key competitive advantages that are poised to materially impact its economic performance over the next 12 months: its leading-edge high-precision manufacturing capabilities, its comprehensive vertically-integrated service model combined with strategic geographical diversification, and its deep specialization and established presence within high-growth, high-value sectors, particularly Medical Technology. These advantages differentiate Fu Yu from generalist manufacturers and enable it to capture higher-margin, sticky projects.</p>

<h3>1. Leading-Edge High-Precision Manufacturing Capabilities</h3>
<p>Fu Yuâ€™s flagship Smart Factory in Singapore stands as a significant competitive advantage, being one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>. This facility enables the manufacturing of complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>. Crucially, it features a 100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>, a critical requirement for medical device production. The Company is actively stabilising high-precision products at the 5-micron precision level and aims to produce even higher levels of precision<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7]</sup>. Furthermore, Fu Yu possesses a unique capability in Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) for producing high-precision metal components in large volumes<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.18]</sup>. Operational efficiency is further enhanced by increasing automation levels in the toolroom, which is projected to reduce downtime by 40% compared to a typical facility from 2025 onwards<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7]</sup>.</p>
<p>This advanced capability directly translates to superior financial prospects by allowing Fu Yu to target and secure higher-margin product categories<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6]</sup>. The ability to manufacture at such high precision levels, particularly with specialized facilities like the cleanroom and MIM, enables Fu Yu to command pricing premiums over competitors lacking similar capabilities. The 40% reduction in downtime from 2025 onwards will significantly improve asset utilization and production throughput, enhancing overall profitability compared to less automated manufacturers. This focus on high-precision products<sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.33]</sup>, which began offering tooling and end products from its Smart Factory in Singapore during FY2024<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6]</sup>, is expected to translate into long-term sustainable revenue<sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.33]</sup>.</p>

<h3>2. Vertically-Integrated Service and Strategic Geographical Diversification</h3>
<p>Fu Yu offers a comprehensive one-stop solution to its customers, encompassing product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>. This vertically-integrated service model is complemented by a strategically diversified manufacturing footprint across 6 sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>. This multi-country presence offers crucial geographical flexibility amidst geopolitical uncertainty<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7]</sup>. Specifically, Fu Yu's facilities in China are focused on "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" strategies in response to US-China trade tensions<sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.13]</sup>.</p>
<p>This competitive advantage drives superior financial outcomes by fostering deeper customer relationships and ensuring revenue stability. The "one-stop" solution reduces supply chain complexity and risk for customers, making Fu Yu a preferred partner compared to competitors offering fragmented services. Projects involving high-precision tooling, facilitated by this integrated approach, are inherently "sticky" and directly translate into long-term sustainable revenue<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.7]</sup>. The geographical diversification enhances resilience against regional disruptions and trade conflicts, allowing Fu Yu to maintain operational continuity and serve diverse market needs, unlike competitors with concentrated manufacturing bases. The "China-for-China" strategy helps secure market access and revenue streams within China, mitigating potential impacts from global trade tensions that might affect less localized competitors.</p>

<h3>3. Specialization and Established Presence in High-Growth, High-Value Sectors (Medical Technology)</h3>
<p>With over 45 years of operating knowledge<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>, Fu Yu serves an international, diverse, and loyal customer base across sectors including life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, and industrial<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>. A strategic enhancement of this advantage is the launch of Fu Yu Biomedical in 2023<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2]</sup>. This focus has already yielded significant wins, including securing a project with an international biomedical company to produce microfluidic chips in 1H2024<sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.11]</sup>, signing a partnership to produce high-precision tools for drug delivery devices<sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.11]</sup>, and an MoU in 1Q2024 to be the exclusive plastics supplier for a local medical device manufacturer<sup>[Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, p.11]</sup>. These new projects, secured in 2H2024<sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.33]</sup>, reflect Fu Yu's growing reputation as a trusted manufacturing partner<sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6]</sup>.</p>
<p>This deep expertise and strategic focus on high-value sectors, particularly Medical Technology, positions Fu Yu for superior financial growth and profitability relative to general precision manufacturers. The long operating history and loyal customer base provide a stable foundation for revenue and reduce customer acquisition costs. The recent specific project wins in 1H2024 and 2H2024 for medical devices demonstrate successful execution of this strategy, with these new projects commencing mass production and set to translate into long-term sustainable revenue for the coming years<sup>[Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.33]</sup>. This strategic shift towards specialized, regulated, and high-margin segments like MedTech ensures higher average contract values and a more resilient revenue stream, differentiating Fu Yu from competitors operating in more commoditized industries.</p>
