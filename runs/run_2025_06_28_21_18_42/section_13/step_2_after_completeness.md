### c. Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While Fu Yu demonstrates strong alignment between its stated objectives and current strategies, a few areas show potential or existing disconnects:

*   **Transparency of "Five Pillars of Transformation":**
    *   **Objective Mentioned:** The Chairman's Message for FY2024 states Fu Yu is on a "growth trajectory that is in line with the five pillars of transformation unveiled in FY2023" [59].
    *   **Strategy Clarity:** However, these "five pillars" are not explicitly detailed or consistently referenced throughout the documents. While the strategies outlined (technology, new products/services, customer traction) align with general transformation themes, the lack of explicit definition for all five pillars makes it challenging to fully assess the comprehensiveness of current strategies against a complete, formally stated strategic framework. This could lead to a perceived gap in strategic communication [60].

*   **Employee Capability Development vs. Training Resource Allocation:**
    *   **Objective:** The Group emphasizes the importance of employee training and development to enhance skills and adapt to new technologies, aiming to position the workforce to meet dynamic demands [61]. It also commits to promoting mental well-being and reducing work-related ill health [62].
    *   **Strategy/Current Practice:** In FY2024, the average training hours per employee decreased from 16 hours (FY2023) to 13.2 hours. This reduction is attributed to "a training budget control and shift in company priorities," with the decline being more pronounced in on-the-job training [63].
    *   **Disconnect:** This presents a potential disconnect where a strategic objective to continuously enhance workforce capabilities and well-being might be under-resourced in the short term due to budget controls and shifting priorities, potentially hindering the pace of skill development necessary for advanced manufacturing and digital transformation.

*   **Performance of China Operations vs. Geographical Flexibility Strategy:**
    *   **Objective:** To optimize geographical flexibility amidst geopolitical uncertainty, Fu Yu plans to evolve revenue contribution by location, with China operations focusing on "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" strategies [64].
    *   **Strategy/Current Outcome:** Despite this strategic intent, Fu Yu's China operations recorded an 11.8% decline in revenue and an increased loss before tax in FY2024 compared to FY2023, attributed to a slower-than-expected economic recovery in China [65].
    *   **Disconnect:** While the strategy acknowledges geopolitical challenges, the current financial performance in China indicates a struggle to effectively implement the "China-for-China/Asia" strategy and achieve the desired revenue evolution in the short term. The internal and external factors appear to be currently overpowering the strategic efforts in this region, creating a temporary disconnect between the strategic aspiration for geographical balance and the current financial reality.
