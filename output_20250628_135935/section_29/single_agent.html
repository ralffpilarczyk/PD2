<h2>Section 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance</h2>

<p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited's ("Fu Yu" or the "Company") operating performance over the last 24 months, as evidenced by the key operating metrics analyzed below, reveals a mixed picture. While the core manufacturing segment demonstrated significant improvement in FY2024, driven by increased order volumes and successful new project wins, particularly in higher-margin segments like biomedical and consumer goods,  the discontinued supply chain management services segment experienced a revenue decline.  The following analysis focuses on three key operating metrics that materially impacted the Company's economic performance during this period.  Benchmarking against competitors is limited due to insufficient publicly available data; however, internal trends and driver analysis provide valuable insights into Fu Yu's operational strengths and challenges. All data points are sourced from the provided Fu Yu 2024 Annual Report (AR) unless otherwise specified.  Page numbers and specific sections are cited where data is directly extracted.</p>


<h3>29.1 Metric 1: Revenue Per User (Manufacturing Segment)</h3>

<p><strong>Definition and Relevance:</strong> Revenue per user (RPU) in the context of Fu Yu's manufacturing segment represents the average revenue generated per customer (or project) over a specific period.  This metric provides insights into the Company's pricing strategy, customer concentration, and ability to generate revenue from existing customers.  Higher RPU indicates strong pricing power and potentially more profitable customer relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Data (FY2023 & FY2024):</strong> Precise quarterly data on RPU is unavailable from the provided documents.  However, the AR (FY2024 Financial Performance, p.4) reports a 10.5% increase in revenue from continuing operations (manufacturing) from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024. While the number of customers isn't explicitly stated, the AR mentions "higher order volumes from existing customers, as well as new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (FY2024 Financial Performance, p.4) implying an increase in RPU. Further details are needed to precisely quantify the RPU change. </p>

<p><strong>Benchmarking and Outperformance/Underperformance:</strong>  Comparative data on RPU for key competitors is not available in the provided documentation, preventing robust benchmarking. </p>

<p><strong>Drivers of Performance:</strong> The increase in overall revenue, coupled with the mention of new projects in higher-margin segments, suggests that improved pricing and successful targeting of premium customers drove the RPU increase in FY2024. Further investigation is required to determine if this increase in RPU is due to growth in average order value, addition of new customers with higher order values or both.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability of Trend:</strong> The sustainability of the RPU growth depends on several factors, including the ability to maintain higher order volumes and secure new, high-value projects; success of the NPI team in acquiring higher margin contracts; sustained demand in the targeted market segments; and effective pricing strategies amidst possible increases in input costs and competition.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> The increased RPU contributed directly to the 10.5% revenue growth in FY2024 from continuing operations (AR, FY2024 Financial Performance, p.4), significantly improving profitability.</p>

<p><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Can you provide a detailed breakdown of revenue per customer (or project) for the last 24 months, segmented by industry and customer type, to demonstrate the trend in RPU? </li>
<li>What specific pricing strategies were implemented in FY2024 to achieve the observed increase in revenue per customer, and what is the plan to maintain or improve this performance in the future?</li>
</ol>


<h3>29.2 Metric 2: Unit Margins (Manufacturing Segment)</h3>

<p><strong>Definition and Relevance:</strong> Unit margin is the profit margin earned on each unit produced, reflecting the efficiency of production and pricing strategies.  It is calculated as (Revenue per unit – Cost per unit) / Revenue per unit.  Higher unit margins indicate better operational efficiency and profitability.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Data (FY2023 & FY2024):</strong>  The AR (FY2024 Financial Highlights, p.7) shows that the gross profit margin from the manufacturing segment improved to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023. This indicates an increase in unit margins.  However, detailed unit-level data is needed for a complete picture.</p>

<p><strong>Benchmarking and Outperformance/Underperformance:</strong> Benchmarking against industry averages or competitors is unavailable due to the lack of external data.</p>

<p><strong>Drivers of Performance:</strong> The improvement in gross profit margin is likely attributed to a combination of factors: increased order volumes leading to better economies of scale; successful implementation of cost-reduction initiatives (e.g., lower energy consumption); a shift towards higher-margin products and improved pricing power. More detailed information on cost per unit across product lines is required.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability of Trend:</strong> The sustainability of the margin improvement hinges upon continued efficiency gains, sustained pricing power, effective management of input costs (raw materials and energy), and successful new product introductions.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> The expansion in unit margins directly contributed to the 27.5% increase in gross profit from the manufacturing segment in FY2024 (AR, FY2024 Financial Highlights, p.7), significantly boosting profitability.</p>

<p><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a detailed breakdown of unit cost and unit revenue for each major product category within the manufacturing segment for the last 24 months, showing the drivers of unit margin changes.</li>
<li>What initiatives have been implemented to reduce production costs, and what is the expected impact of these initiatives on future unit margins?</li>
</ol>


<h3>29.3 Metric 3: Customer Churn/Retention (Manufacturing Segment)</h3>

<p><strong>Definition and Relevance:</strong> Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop doing business with the Company, while retention is the opposite – the percentage of customers who continue their relationship. In high precision manufacturing, customer relationships are usually sticky; longer customer relationships often lead to higher profitability.  Low churn indicates strong customer loyalty and long-term sustainable revenue streams.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Data (FY2023 & FY2024):</strong>  The AR (Chairman's Message, p.5; Conclusion and Outlook, p.6) indicates an increase in order book at the end of FY2024 (20% year-on-year), and mentions "higher order volumes and interest in increasing order volumes from existing customers".  This suggests relatively low customer churn and high retention rates. However, quantitative data on customer churn/retention rates is required for a complete assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Benchmarking and Outperformance/Underperformance:</strong>  Benchmarking is impossible due to a lack of comparable data on customer churn and retention rates in the provided documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Drivers of Performance:</strong> The high customer retention rates are likely due to the high quality of Fu Yu's products and services; strong customer relationships cultivated through collaboration and value-added services; and  the "sticky" nature of projects requiring high-precision tooling and long-term partnerships.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability of Trend:</strong> Maintaining low churn requires continuous improvement in product and service quality; strengthening customer relationships; and proactively addressing any potential customer dissatisfaction. Competition and market changes could also impact retention rates.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> High customer retention directly contributes to predictable and sustainable revenue streams, improving overall profitability and reducing the cost of customer acquisition.</p>

<p><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What are the customer churn and retention rates for the manufacturing segment over the last 24 months, segmented by customer type and industry?  What are the main reasons for customer churn?</li>
<li>What strategies are in place to further improve customer retention and reduce churn in the future?</li>
</ol>
