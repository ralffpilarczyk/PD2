Similarly, operating profit from continuing operations swung from a loss of S$(7.3) million in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.4 million in FY2024 Operating Profit/(Loss) from Continuing Operations was S$0.4 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>, and the loss from continuing operations narrowed significantly by 84.2% to S$(1.2) million Loss from Continuing Operations narrowed by 84.2% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>.</li>

This persistent loss is primarily attributable to the increasing losses from discontinued operations.</li>
<li><strong>Discontinued Operations as a Drag:</strong> Losses from discontinued operations increased by 32.0% from S$(2.5) million in FY2023 to S$(3.3) million in FY2024 Loss from Discontinued Operations increased by 32.0% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>, offsetting some of the gains from continuing operations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> Improved by 1.8 percentage points, from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024 Gross Profit Margin for continuing operations improved by 1.8 percentage points <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>.

</ul>

<h3>b. MD&A highlighting key recent trends</h3>

<p><strong>Performance Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Given the limited historical data (two years) and absence of guidance or industry benchmarks, the assessment focuses on the internal improvements and challenges observed.</p>

<p><strong>Key Drivers of Performance:</strong><br>
The primary driver for the improved financial performance is the strong rebound and efficiency gains within the <strong>continuing operations</strong>. This is evidenced by the significant revenue growth, substantial improvements in gross profit margin, and a decisive turnaround from operating loss to operating profit, leading to a substantial narrowing of the loss from continuing operations.</p>

<p><strong>2 Key Achievements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Remarkable Turnaround in Continuing Operations' Profitability:</strong> Fu Yu achieved a significant improvement in its core business. Operating profit from continuing operations swung from a loss of S$(7.3) million in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.4 million in FY2024 Operating Profit/(Loss) from Continuing Operations was S$0.4 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>. This was further underscored by an impressive surge in EBITDA from continuing operations from S$0.6 million to S$8.5 million EBITDA from Continuing Operations was S$8.5 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup> and a 1.8 percentage point improvement in gross profit margin to 13.5% Gross Profit Margin for continuing operations improved by 1.8 percentage points <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Revenue Growth:</strong> The company successfully grew revenue from continuing operations by 10.5% from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024 Revenue for continuing operations grew 10.5% from S$103.9 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>. This indicates successful top-line expansion in its core business activities, demonstrating market traction and demand.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2 Key Challenges:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increasing Losses from Discontinued Operations:</strong> Despite the strong performance of continuing operations, the overall consolidated net loss was negatively impacted by a 32.0% increase in losses from discontinued operations, growing from S$(2.5) million in FY2023 to S$(3.3) million in FY2024 Loss from Discontinued Operations increased by 32.0% <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>. This suggests that the wind-down or divestment of these operations might be more costly or prolonged than anticipated, preventing the company from achieving overall profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Consolidated Net Loss and Declining Cash Balance:</strong> Even with significant improvements in continuing operations, the company recorded a consolidated net loss of S$(3.9) million in FY2024 Net Loss was S$(3.9) million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>. Furthermore, cash and bank balances decreased from S$60.3 million to S$55.5 million Cash and bank balances were S$55.5 million <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]</sup>, indicating a net cash outflow. While the net cash position provides a buffer, the combination of ongoing consolidated losses and declining cash warrants attention regarding the company's long-term self-sufficiency and funding needs.</li>
</ol>
