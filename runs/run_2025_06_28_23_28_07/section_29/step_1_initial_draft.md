## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance over the last 24 months, particularly within its core manufacturing segment, indicates a strategic pivot and nascent recovery. The Group has successfully improved its manufacturing gross profit margins and achieved consistent revenue growth in this segment, driven by new project wins and increased order volumes. This positive momentum in manufacturing is crucial, especially as the Group has ceased its Supply Chain Management Services segment, which was not only underperforming but also subject to a qualified audit opinion due to significant internal control weaknesses and ongoing investigations. While overall Group profitability remains a concern due to prior losses, the operational improvements in manufacturing suggest an enhanced focus on core competencies and efficiency.

### 1. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Definition and Relevance:**
Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin measures the percentage of revenue from the manufacturing segment that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold. It is a critical operating metric that reflects the Company's efficiency in production, cost management, and pricing power. A higher GPM indicates better operational efficiency, effective cost control, and potentially stronger demand or a more favorable pricing environment for its products. In the precision engineering industry, GPM is a key indicator of competitive advantage and sustainable unit economics.

**Benchmarking:**
The provided documents do not offer specific GPM data for key competitors or industry averages in the high-precision plastic and metal components manufacturing sector. Therefore, quantitative benchmarking against external peers is not possible from the given information. However, the internal trend shows a significant improvement.

**Analysis of Drivers:**
Manufacturing GPM significantly improved from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024, representing a 1.8 percentage point (ppt) increase [^4]. The most notable improvement occurred in 1H 2024, reaching 15.51% from 12.17% in 1H 2023. This was driven by:
*   **Higher Order Volumes and New Projects:** The Company secured new projects in higher-margin product categories, such as biomedical and consumer segments, and recorded higher order volumes from existing customers [^2]. This likely allowed for better absorption of fixed costs and improved production efficiency.
*   **Strategic Transformation Initiatives:** The Company's focus on "advanced tooling with high precision" and the introduction of its New Product Introduction ("NPI") team have enabled it to add value in early stages of the business cycle, attracting customers in higher-margin segments [^2].
*   **Cost Management:** Management documents highlight "lower expenses relating to employee costs, travelling expenses, water and electricity charges and sundry expenses" [^11] contributing to overall gross profit increase.

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
The current upward trend in GPM for the manufacturing segment appears sustainable in the short to medium term. The Company explicitly states that "several high-precision projects that had been gestating for several months are now ready for mass production" and are expected to translate into "long-term sustainable revenue" due to the "relatively 'sticky' nature of projects involving high-precision tooling" [^1]. The ongoing transition to electric machinery and investments in Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g., Smart Factory, 3D metal printing) are expected to further enhance operational efficiency and potentially unit margins [^12]. However, the 2H 2024 GPM (14.08%) showed a slight dip compared to 1H 2024 (15.51%), which may warrant further investigation.

**Quantify Financial Impact:**
The 1.8 ppt increase in manufacturing GPM from FY2023 to FY2024 (from 11.7% to 13.5%) translated into a 28.1% increase in manufacturing gross profit, from S$12.1 million in FY2023 to S$15.5 million in FY2024 [^4]. This S$3.4 million increase in gross profit significantly contributed to the sharp narrowing of net loss from continuing operations (from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024) [^13].

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What specific internal initiatives and pricing strategies were implemented in 1H 2024 that led to the significant 3.34 ppt increase in manufacturing GPM from 2H 2023 to 1H 2024, and what caused the subsequent 1.43 ppt decrease in GPM from 1H 2024 to 2H 2024?
2.  Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing GPM by product category (e.g., life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, industrial) or by new vs. existing projects, to assess the quality and sustainability of margin expansion?

### 2. Manufacturing Revenue Growth

**Definition and Relevance:**
Manufacturing Revenue Growth measures the percentage increase in top-line sales generated specifically from the Company's core manufacturing operations. It is a critical indicator of market penetration, demand for the Company's products, and its ability to secure new business and expand existing relationships. For a contract manufacturer, consistent revenue growth signifies success in customer acquisition (new projects) and retention (higher order volumes from existing customers), ultimately reflecting an expanding operational footprint.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Period  | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | YoY Growth (%) | Source |
|---------|------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| 1H 2023 | 52.6                               | -              | [^7]   |
| 2H 2023 | 51.3                               | -              | [^6]   |
| FY 2023 | 103.9                              | -              | [^4]   |
| 1H 2024 | 54.8                               | 4.2%           | [^7]   |
| 2H 2024 | 60.1                               | 17.1%          | [^6]   |
| FY 2024 | 114.9                              | 10.5%          | [^4]   |

**Benchmarking:**
No explicit industry average or competitor revenue growth rates are provided in the documents for direct comparison.

**Analysis of Drivers:**
The manufacturing segment experienced a robust 10.5% revenue growth from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024 [^4]. This growth trajectory accelerated in 2H 2024 with a 17.1% increase compared to 2H 2023. Key drivers include:
*   **New Project Wins:** The Company secured new projects in biomedical, consumer (e.g., myFirst products, next-generation coffee machines), drone technology, and smart appliances segments [^2], [^14]. This is a direct result of investments in advanced tooling and the new NPI team [^2].
*   **Higher Order Volumes from Existing Customers:** The Company reported increased order volumes and interest in growing order volumes from its existing customer base [^1]. This suggests strong customer satisfaction and retention.
*   **Geographical Shift:** While China operations revenue declined by 11.8% in FY2024, sales from Singapore and Malaysia operations improved by 20.9% and 24.9% respectively [^15], offsetting the decline and reflecting a successful diversification away from China amid geopolitical uncertainties [^1].

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
The trend of manufacturing revenue growth appears sustainable. The Company's order book at the end of FY2024 increased 20% year-on-year [^1], providing a strong base for FY2025. The strategic focus on high-precision, higher-margin sectors like medical devices and consumer products, combined with geographical diversification, enhances revenue stability. The completion of initial prototyping and mold development for new high-precision projects, now ready for mass production, also bodes well for future revenue streams [^1].

**Quantify Financial Impact:**
The 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue for FY2024 contributed S$11.0 million in additional revenue to the Group's continuing operations. This top-line expansion, coupled with improved gross margins, was a primary factor in the significant reduction of the Group's net loss from continuing operations (from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024) [^13].

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  Given the 20% year-on-year increase in the order book by end of FY2024, what is the projected manufacturing revenue growth for FY2025, and how much of this is locked in through long-term contracts?
2.  What is the specific revenue contribution from the "higher-margin product categories" (e.g., medical, biomedical) relative to the total manufacturing revenue, and what are the strategies to increase this mix further?

### 3. Manufacturing Energy Intensity

**Definition and Relevance:**
Manufacturing Energy Intensity measures the total energy consumed (in Gigajoules, GJ) per million Singapore Dollars of revenue generated from the manufacturing segment. This metric is a direct operational indicator of asset utilization and efficiency in resource consumption. A lower energy intensity indicates that the Company is becoming more efficient in its use of energy to produce goods and generate revenue, which directly impacts unit economics and environmental footprint. This is particularly relevant in an industry with significant machinery and cleanroom operations.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Period  | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | Energy Intensity (GJ/S$ Million Revenue) | Source |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| FY 2023 | 118,698.7                  | 103.9                              | 1,142.4                                  | [^8]   |
| FY 2024 | 119,942.0                  | 114.9                              | 1,043.9                                  | [^8]   |

**Benchmarking:**
The provided documents do not include energy intensity benchmarks for competitors or the broader industry.

**Analysis of Drivers:**
Manufacturing Energy Intensity improved from 1,142.4 GJ/S$mil revenue in FY2023 to 1,043.9 GJ/S$mil revenue in FY2024, representing an 8.6% improvement in energy efficiency per unit of revenue [^8]. This positive trend is driven by several internal initiatives:
*   **Investment in Energy-Efficient Machinery:** The Group is "replacing hydraulic machinery with electric alternatives" and "replacing older machinery that consumes more energy with newer energy-efficient machinery" [^12].
*   **Transition to Renewable Energy:** Installation of solar panels at Singapore facilities was completed in FY2024, with expansion plans in Malaysia (Fu Hao operational in 4Q FY2024, CA by 2Q FY2025) [^16]. This reduces reliance on grid electricity, which can be carbon-intensive and subject to price volatility.
*   **Operational Optimization:** Initiatives like "optimise production planning to reduce machinery idling time" and "use of frequency conversion air compressors" contribute to overall energy savings [^12].

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
The Company's commitment to reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions is stated as a "broader sustainability strategy" [^17]. With solar panel projects still rolling out in Malaysia and ongoing replacement of older machinery, further improvements in energy intensity are highly probable. The goal to increase automation levels (e.g., overnight production in toolroom) could further optimize asset utilization and potentially reduce energy intensity despite increased production [^1].

**Quantify Financial Impact:**
The 8.6% reduction in energy intensity in FY2024, even with increased revenue, indicates more efficient energy use. While the direct monetary savings from this efficiency are not explicitly quantified, the Company notes that its initiatives align with "unlocking significant cost savings for our business" [^12] and mitigate the impact of rising energy costs [^18]. In a period of increasing electricity rates due to carbon taxes [^18], this operational efficiency is crucial for maintaining cost competitiveness and supporting margin expansion.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What is the projected energy intensity for FY2025 considering the full operationalization of solar panels in Malaysian facilities and planned machinery upgrades?
2.  What is the estimated cost savings (S$ thousands) directly attributable to the 8.6% improvement in energy intensity in FY2024, and what is the target for future savings?
