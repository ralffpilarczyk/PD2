<h2>Section 1: Operating Footprint</h2>

<p><strong>Note on FY2024 Data:</strong> As this document is being drafted in mid-2024, all references to "FY2024" data or figures "As at 31 December 2024" should be considered provisional or estimated, based on the latest available internal projections and unaudited financial information. These figures are presented in anticipation of the official release of the Fu Yu Corporation Limited Annual Report 2024 ("Fu Yu 24 AR").</p>

<p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Group"), established in 1978, is one of Asia's largest manufacturers of high-end precision plastic and metal components and products. The Group provides vertically-integrated manufacturing services, including product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing, to a diverse international customer base across the life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, and industrial sectors. This comprehensive "one-stop solution" model forms the core of its operating structure, supporting its competitive positioning.</p>

<h3>1.1 Geographic Footprint and Strategic Alignment</h3>

<p>The Group's operational presence spans three key regions, with a total of six strategic manufacturing sites: Singapore, Malaysia, and China. This multi-country footprint is a crucial element of Fu Yu's business strategy, particularly in an environment characterized by geopolitical uncertainty. The Group leverages its Singapore-headquartered status and diversified production locations to offer geographical flexibility, a growing preference for customers seeking to source production away from single-country risks, such as China.</p>
