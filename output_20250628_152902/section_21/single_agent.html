<p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Company" or "Fu Yu") possesses several material competitive advantages that are poised to significantly impact its economic performance over the next 12 months, primarily stemming from its core manufacturing segment. These advantages allow Fu Yu to differentiate itself from competitors, secure higher-value projects, and navigate a challenging global operating environment.</p>

<p>Here are the 3 most important competitive advantages materially impacting the Company's economic performance over the next 12 months:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Advanced High-Precision Manufacturing Capabilities & Niche Market Focus:</strong> Fu Yu’s flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, combined with its expertise in high-precision tooling and specialized cleanroom manufacturing, provides a significant competitive edge, enabling it to target and serve high-growth, high-margin sectors. The Smart Factory is capable of manufacturing complex mould inserts and high-precision 3D metal printing for rapid prototyping, and features a 100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products.<sup>1</sup> This positions Fu Yu as "one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities"<sup>2</sup>. The Company is "stabilising high-precision products at the 5-micron precision level and moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision"<sup>3</sup>. This technical prowess translates directly to superior financial performance by attracting high-value projects in sectors like medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances.<sup>4</sup> For example, Fu Yu secured a project with an international biomedical company in 1H2024 to produce microfluidic chips for medical diagnostic devices and signed a partnership to produce high-precision tools for drug delivery devices.<sup>5</sup> These capabilities contributed to a significant improvement in the manufacturing segment’s gross profit margin, which rose to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023, outpacing the overall Group’s gross profit margin improvement from 7.0% to 8.9% over the same period.<sup>6</sup> The strategic focus on these "higher-margin product categories"<sup>7</sup> is expected to continue driving profitability. Additionally, the Company's ongoing investment in "energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines"<sup>8</sup> and the "integration of 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies"<sup>9</sup> enhance operational efficiency and reduce waste, further strengthening its cost structure relative to less technologically advanced competitors.</p>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Geographical Diversification and Supply Chain Resilience:</strong> Fu Yu’s distributed manufacturing network across Singapore, Malaysia, and China offers customers crucial geographical flexibility and supply chain de-risking amidst geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in relation to sourcing away from China. The Group operates 6 strategic manufacturing sites with over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity.<sup>10</sup> As a "Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company with production in three countries, [Fu Yu] can offer geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty."<sup>11</sup> This advantage is clearly demonstrated by the shifts in revenue contribution: while China's share of manufacturing revenue declined by 7.1 percentage points in FY2024, Singapore's operations gained 20.9 percentage points to S$46.2 million (20.9% growth YoY) and Malaysia's operations gained 24.9 percentage points to S$36.6 million (24.9% growth YoY).<sup>12</sup> The higher growth rates in Singapore and Malaysia (20.9% and 24.9% respectively in FY2024) compared to the overall manufacturing revenue growth of 10.5% in FY2024<sup>13</sup> highlight the successful execution of its multi-country strategy. This diversification reduces reliance on any single market and mitigates regional supply chain disruptions, such as those from extreme weather events, by allowing the Company to "actively diversify its suppliers globally."<sup>14</sup> This stability and flexibility make Fu Yu a more attractive and reliable partner compared to competitors with concentrated geographical footprints, directly translating to securing new projects and higher order volumes from existing customers.<sup>15</sup></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Vertically Integrated "One-Stop Solution" and Deep Customer Relationships:</strong> Fu Yu provides a comprehensive "one-stop solution" for customers’ manufacturing needs, spanning product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing.<sup>16</sup> This vertically integrated approach streamlines the manufacturing process for customers, fostering strong, loyal, and "sticky" customer relationships. The Company has an "international, diverse and loyal customer base"<sup>17</sup> and its New Product Introduction ("NPI") team "add[s] value in the early stages of the business cycle," instilling confidence in new customers for scaling production while maintaining quality.<sup>18</sup> This integrated service offering and proactive customer engagement have resulted in tangible financial benefits. The Group's manufacturing revenue grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million in FY2024, driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and new project wins.<sup>19</sup> Furthermore, Fu Yu's order book at the end of FY2024 increased by 20% year-on-year, primarily due to "higher order volumes and interest in increasing order volumes from existing customers."<sup>20</sup> This strong customer retention and expansion, especially within high-precision tooling projects that are inherently "sticky"<sup>21</sup>, indicate a robust competitive moat. The Singapore manufacturing segment, benefiting from these deep customer relationships and new projects, reversed a loss before tax of S$6.9 million in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S$1.2 million in FY2024.<sup>22</sup> This demonstrates how offering an end-to-end solution and nurturing long-term partnerships translates into superior and sustainable revenue and profit generation compared to less integrated competitors.</p>
