### c. Disconnects Between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

Based on the provided data, there are **no apparent disconnects** between Fu Yu's stated strategic objectives and its current corporate strategies. The corporate strategies are well-aligned with and actively support the strategic objectives:

*   The objective to **Advance High-Precision Manufacturing & Value Chain Ascent** is directly supported by the strategy of **Focused Vertical Integration in High-Precision Manufacturing** (leveraging the Smart Factory and end-to-end services) and the **Strategic Market Diversification into High-Growth, Higher-Margin Sectors** (which inherently demand high-precision capabilities).
*   The objective to **Drive Environmental Sustainability and Resource Efficiency** is evident in the ongoing operational improvements mentioned within the core manufacturing processes and facility upgrades (e.g., solar panels, energy-efficient machinery, waste management).
*   The objective to **Achieve Zero Workplace Incidents and Enhance Workforce Capability** is supported by continuous training programs, EHS initiatives, and robust human capital management strategies including remuneration and long-term incentives.
*   The **Resource Reallocation to Strengthen Core Manufacturing Capabilities** through the divestment of the supply chain arm explicitly serves to enhance the company's ability to achieve its core manufacturing and efficiency objectives by concentrating resources where they can deliver the most strategic impact.

In summary, Fu Yu's strategies demonstrate a cohesive and integrated approach, with current competitive actions directly bolstering its stated future goals.
