ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
- **Prioritize Meticulous Sourcing and Formatting:** Always ensure every data point is precisely sourced with detailed references, and adhere strictly to specified output formats (tables, bullet points, bolding, etc.) for enhanced credibility and readability.
- **Employ "What-Why-So What" for Deep Insights:** For every key observation ("What"), provide a clear explanation of its underlying causes ("Why") and articulate its implications, risks, or opportunities ("So What") to deliver profound value.
- **Investigate Intra-Period Dynamics:** Actively analyze and explain significant fluctuations within reported periods (e.g., 1H vs. 2H performance) to uncover strategic shifts or operational nuances.
- **Identify and Explain Disconnects:** Proactively seek out and highlight discrepancies between management's narrative or guidance and the actual financial performance, providing detailed financial explanations for these disconnects to offer a critical, independent assessment.
- **Front-Load Key Narratives:** Begin the analysis with a concise, high-level summary that immediately encapsulates the overarching financial story and key findings.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
- **Strictly Adhere to All Requirements:** Always fulfill all explicit data points, time periods, and formatting requirements, even if a superior analytical alternative is also presented.
- **Verify Fundamental Metric Definitions:** Rigorously cross-check and confirm the accuracy of all financial metric definitions and calculations (e.g., GAAP vs. Non-GAAP, EBIT vs. EBITDA) to prevent critical definitional errors.
- **Ensure Data Completeness:** Prioritize securing comprehensive data for all requested time periods and metrics; if genuinely unavailable from provided sources, explicitly state this limitation as a constraint on the analysis.
- **Integrate Methodological Rationale:** Embed explanations for analytical choices or metric substitutions (e.g., why one ratio is preferred over another) directly within the main text where the metric is discussed, rather than in detached footnotes.
- **Avoid Redundancy Through Synthesis:** Ensure the Management Discussion and Analysis (MDNA) synthesizes and evaluates previously presented data and insights, rather than merely restating detailed findings, to maintain conciseness.
- **Enhance Narrative Flow:** Use specific, value-adding introductory statements and smooth transition sentences between sections to improve the overall readability and logical progression of the analysis.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
- **Quantify Strategic Impact:** For financial analyses involving strategic shifts (e.g., divestitures, re-focusing), explicitly quantify the specific financial impact on revenue, margins, and other metrics for both continuing and discontinued operations.
- **Deep-Dive into Cash Flow Drivers:** Beyond reporting cash flow figures, thoroughly investigate and explain the underlying drivers of Operating Cash Flow, particularly working capital movements, to provide a complete understanding of cash conversion and liquidity.
- **Establish Future Baselines:** Translate historical performance and strategic changes into a projection of the "new normal" or future baseline for key financial metrics (e.g., revenue run-rate, sustainable margins) for the focused business.
- **Incorporate External Benchmarks:** Consistently integrate industry comparisons or peer performance data for key financial metrics to provide external context and assess the company's competitive standing.
- **Ensure Foundational Accuracy:** Double-check the precise definition and calculation of all reported financial metrics (e.g., GAAP/Non-GAAP labeling, EBIT vs. EBITDA) as accuracy here is paramount for financial credibility.
