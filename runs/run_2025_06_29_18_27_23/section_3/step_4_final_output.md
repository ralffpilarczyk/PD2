## SECTION 3: Key Customers

Maxis Berhad serves diverse Consumer and Enterprise divisions in Malaysia.

### a. List of Largest Customers

Maxis does not explicitly name individual "largest customers" but segments its base:
*   **Consumer:** Largest, encompassing individual mobile (postpaid/prepaid) and home connectivity users. Mobile Revenue Generating Subscribers (RGS): 10.56 million (Q1 2025). Home Connections: 787,000 (Q1 2025).
*   **Enterprise:** Serves businesses (corporates, SMEs, public sector), highlighting partnerships (e.g., AWS) and the Maxis 5G Alliance.
*   **Wholesale Customers/Partners:** Other Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) for 2G/4G wholesale. Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) is a significant 5G wholesale provider *to* Maxis, also a potential future partner in a dual 5G network model.
*   **Related Parties:** Material transactions with related parties, including MEASAT (Astro) and DNB.

### b. Position in the Value Chain

Maxis is a **Tier 1 service provider** (B2C, B2B) and **Tier 1 supplier** (2G/4G wholesale). The dual 5G network model could shift its 5G position from wholesale customer to network operator.

### c. Relationship Strength and Duration

Maxis reports high customer satisfaction with an All-time high TP-NPS of **+70** (FY2024). However, a critical omission is **specific customer churn rates**. NPS measures satisfaction, not retention; high NPS can coexist with substantial churn. Without churn, true relationship strength and duration remain speculative, impairing assessment of stickiness and investor forecasting.

### d. Products Purchased by Each Key Customer and Associated Metrics

Maxis's product offerings align with its segments:

**1. Consumer Mobile**
*   **Products:** Postpaid plans (unlimited 5G), Hotlink (data plans).
*   **Critical Insight:** **Mobile ARPU for both postpaid and prepaid segments declined Q4 FY2024 to Q1 FY2025, despite increased data usage per customer.** This suggests sacrificing revenue per user for subscriber growth in a competitive environment, impacting profitability.

| Metric                        | FY2024 (Q4) | 1Q25  | % Change (QoQ) |
| :---------------------------- | :---------- | :---- | :------------- |
| Postpaid ARPU (RM)            | 74.5        | 71.8  | -3.62%         |
| Prepaid ARPU (RM)             | 36.5        | 34.3  | -6.03%         |
| Data Usage (GB/month) Postpaid | 33.8        | 35.0  | +3.55%         |
| Data Usage (GB/month) Prepaid  | 29.5        | 31.9  | +8.14%         |

**2. Consumer Home**
*   **Products:** Maxis Fibre, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) with 5G.
*   **Metrics:** Home Connections: 787,000 (Q1 2025). Home Blended ARPU: RM110.1 (Q1 2025).

**3. Enterprise**
*   **Products:** Connectivity, IoT, Cloud, AI, Cybersecurity, SD-WAN.
*   **Metrics:** Enterprise Mobile Revenue: RM213 million (Q1 2025). Enterprise Fixed & Solutions Revenue: RM185 million (Q1 2025).
*   **Critical Insight:** Absence of Enterprise ARPU and "non-recurring charges from project completions" (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 8) introduce revenue volatility, requiring monitoring of recurring service revenue.

### e. Customer Segmentation by Industry and Geography

Segmented by **Industry** (Consumer, Enterprise) and **Geography** (predominantly Malaysia, with roaming revenue of RM220M in FY2024).

### f. Customer Positioning (Premium, Mid-market, Value Segments)

Maxis employs a dual-brand approach: **Maxis Postpaid** targets premium users; **Hotlink** (postpaid/prepaid) targets value segments. Enterprise solutions are tiered by business size.

### g. Revenue Contribution and Customer Concentration

Consumer and Enterprise segments drive revenue, with **Consumer contributing the majority** (~81.8% in FY2024). No significant customer concentration risk is apparent. Related party transactions are minor.

**Critical Stance:** Management's Q4 2024 commentary stating "total subscribers by... 9.7 billion subscribers" (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 6) is an obvious typo (RGS are in millions), highlighting the importance of data verification.

### h. Purchase Patterns and Contract Terms

Maxis encourages prepaid to postpaid transitions (+7.9% YoY postpaid growth FY2024) for stable revenue, supported by device bundling (Zerolution). Enterprise emphasizes diversified digital solutions, but revenue can be influenced by non-recurring project charges. Wholesale (DNB) involves long-term 5G engagement.

**Critical Insight:** The "new commercial arrangement for SafeDevice program" impacted Q1 2025 service revenue recognition (Maxis 25Q1 TS, slide 4). This accounting change, while not impacting EBITDA, can obscure underlying operational performance trends.
