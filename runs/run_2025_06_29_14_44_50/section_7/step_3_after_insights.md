## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated) - Comprehensive Analysis

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's consolidated financial performance for the last two financial years (FY2023, FY2024) and the most recent four interim periods (1H2023, 2H2023, 1H2024, 2H2024) reveals a company in transition, navigating a challenging economic landscape while undertaking strategic shifts. The Group's decision to cease its supply chain management services segment in late FY2024 significantly impacts the consolidated figures, leading to a re-presentation of prior period financials to separate continuing and discontinued operations. This analysis incorporates both GAAP (e.g., Net Income) and non-GAAP (e.g., EBITDA) measures to provide a comprehensive view of performance, particularly focusing on the underlying operational health of the continuing business.

*Note on Interim Data: 1H figures are calculated as FY total minus 2H figures. Discrepancies between audited Annual Report (AR) and unaudited Financial Statements (FS) for full-year discontinued operations net loss (AR: S\$3,260k vs FS: S\$2,672k) highlight re-presentation complexities. AR figures are used for full-year, FS for interim, indicating potential year-end adjustments.*

**Analysis of Financial Performance:**

Fu Yu's strategic transformation, focusing on "high-precision manufacturing," is evident in the **continuing operations**. Revenue from this core segment grew by a solid 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers, as well as new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (AR p.6). Geographically, Singapore and Malaysia operations saw significant sales improvements (20.9% and 24.9% respectively), offsetting an 11.8% decline in China due to a "slower-than-expected recovery" (AR p.8). This indicates a successful shift in market focus and diversification away from a struggling Chinese market.

Profitability in the continuing operations has sharply improved. Gross Profit Margin rose from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024, indicating improved efficiency or pricing power. More strikingly, **EBITDA from continuing operations surged over 14-fold from S$0.6 million in FY2023 to S$8.5 million in FY2024**, demonstrating a significant turnaround in core operational profitability. This positive trend is further underscored by the narrowing of net loss from continuing operations, from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to just S$1.2 million in FY2024. Management highlights that excluding a one-off non-cash impairment of S$0.6 million, this loss would have been even lower at S$0.6 million (AR p.6), emphasizing the importance of non-GAAP adjustments to reveal underlying performance.

The narrative of "a company in transition" is strongly defined by the cessation of the supply chain management services segment. This segment contributed a substantial portion of total revenue (39.9% in FY2024), though declining, and recorded an increasing net loss (S$2.5 million in FY2023 to S$3.3 million in FY2024, AR p.143). The decision to cease was explicitly "due to the inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" (FS Q424 p.15). Critically, this segment has been subject to an **ongoing investigation into its affairs, highlighting "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process," "unverifiable arrangements," and "unauthorized usage of the email account"** (AR p.7, p.104). The auditor has issued a **qualified opinion** due to inability to determine the full financial impact of this investigation (AR p.104), casting a shadow over past consolidated figures and future legal exposures. The substantial goodwill impairment of S$3.3 million in FY2024 is directly linked to the cessation of this troubled segment (AR p.142).

From a broader financial health perspective, the Group generated **net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024**, a significant reversal from an S$4.5 million outflow in FY2023 (AR p.6), indicating improved liquidity from operations. The balance sheet remains "healthy, with net cash of S$55.5 million," equivalent to 7.3 cents per share (AR p.6). This strong cash position provides a buffer for ongoing strategic investments, including S$6.9 million in capital expenditure for factory equipment and machinery (AR p.9).

In conclusion, while the consolidated net loss is still present, the underlying core manufacturing business of Fu Yu Corporation Limited shows a clear and positive trajectory of recovery and strategic realignment, marked by revenue growth, margin improvement, and a strong rebound in operational profitability. The ongoing investigation and qualified audit opinion related to the discontinued supply chain segment represent a significant legacy issue that warrants close monitoring, but appears isolated from the improving fundamentals of the continuing manufacturing operations. Management's forward-looking statements of a 20% year-on-year increase in the order book for FY2025 (AR p.7) further underpin the optimism for the core business.
