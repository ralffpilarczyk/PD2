ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
-   **Prioritize the identification and articulation of causal relationships and their quantitative impact**, as these provide the most profound understanding and actionable insights by explaining *why* outcomes occur.
-   **Systematically apply structured decomposition and comparative analysis** to dissect complex problems, revealing granular patterns, performance variations, and underlying drivers across different dimensions or timeframes.
-   **Focus on uncovering interdependencies between seemingly disparate variables and their direct influence on key outcomes**, using these relationships to explain observed phenomena, predict future behavior, or identify leverage points for intervention.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
-   **Establish a comprehensive analytical scope and detailed methodology upfront**, explicitly outlining all data requirements, sources, assumptions, and the precise questions the analysis must answer to prevent significant omissions or rework.
-   **Ensure the analysis systematically progresses beyond mere descriptive data presentation to diagnostic interpretation and prescriptive recommendations**, rigorously validating findings through triangulation from multiple sources and robust sensitivity testing.
-   **Before initiating the analysis, clearly define the target audience and the specific purpose of the output section**, using these insights to develop a detailed checklist for required content, depth of detail, and appropriate presentation standards for the first attempt.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
-   **Design appendix sections with an emphasis on hyper-structured clarity and methodological transparency**, using clear headings, detailed descriptions, and logical flow to enable expert users to easily navigate, validate, and reproduce the analysis.
-   **Consistently document all assumptions, limitations, and the complete data lineage (including all cleaning, transformation, and aggregation steps)**, ensuring the analysis is fully contextualized, defensible, and replicable by external parties.
-   **Provide the granular evidence and detailed methodological breakdowns necessary to fully substantiate every claim made in the main report**, focusing on underlying drivers, specific data points, edge cases, and robust sensitivity analyses rather than high-level summaries.
