## SECTION 32: Appendix - Expert Business Analysis

### Executive Summary

Fu Yu Corporation Limited is undergoing a strategic transformation, divesting from its problematic Supply Chain Management Services (SCMS) segment to refocus on its core high-precision manufacturing. While the manufacturing segment shows promising growth and improved profitability, the Group's overall financial performance remains challenged by persistent losses and a declining cash position. Significant governance issues surrounding the discontinued SCMS segment, including an ongoing investigation and a qualified audit opinion, pose a substantial risk to investor confidence and the Group's reputation. Despite an optimistic outlook from management, the data suggests a complex turnaround with significant operational and financial hurdles to navigate.

### 1.0 Key Financial Performance Analysis

#### 1.1 Revenue and Profitability: Strategic Shift Underway
The Group's total revenue for FY2024 saw a marginal increase of 0.5% to S\$191.3 million (FY2023: S\$190.4 million) (Table 2.3). This overall stability, however, masks a significant internal rebalancing.
*   **Manufacturing Segment Strength:** Revenue from continuing manufacturing operations grew by a strong 10.5% to S\$114.9 million (FY2023: S\$103.9 million), driven by Singapore (+20.9% to S\$46.2 million) and Malaysia (+24.9% to S\$36.6 million) (Table 2.3, 4.1). This growth in high-precision manufacturing, especially in medical and consumer segments, validates the strategic focus.
*   **SCMS Drag:** The discontinued SCMS segment's revenue declined to S\$76.4 million in FY2024 (FY2023: S\$86.4 million) (Table 2.3), reflecting the decision to cease its operations due to underperformance and inability to secure suitable leadership.
*   **Gross Profit Improvement:** Group-wide gross profit increased by 27.8% to S\$17.0 million (FY2023: S\$13.3 million), with gross profit margin improving from 7.0% to 8.9% (Table 2.1). The manufacturing segment's gross profit margin specifically improved from 11.7% to 13.5% (Table 2.1), indicating better cost management and product mix in its core business.
*   **Persistent Net Loss:** Despite the positive trends in manufacturing, the Group still recorded a net loss of S\$3.9 million in FY2024, albeit a significant improvement from the S\$10.1 million net loss in FY2023 (Table 2.1). This indicates that the positive impact from manufacturing and cost-cutting (Selling and Administrative expenses down 20.4%) is still insufficient to offset overall losses, heavily influenced by the discontinued operations.
*   **EBITDA Rebound:** EBITDA from continuing operations surged to S\$8.5 million (FY2023: S\$0.6 million) (Table 2.1), a strong indicator that the core business is generating healthy operational cash flow before non-cash charges and financing costs. This aligns with the Chairman's message of "sharp improvement" in the core manufacturing segment.

#### 1.2 Financial Position and Cash Flow: Declining Liquidity
The Group maintains a sound financial position with S\$136.2 million in Shareholders' Equity and "Net Cash" gearing (Table 2.1). However, a closer look reveals potential concerns:
*   **Cash and Bank Balances:** Cash and bank balances decreased to S\$55.5 million as at 31 Dec 2024 from S\$60.3 million a year prior (Table 2.2). While still substantial, this is a continued decline from FY2022's S\$71.4 million (Table 2.5).
*   **Operating Cash Flow Turnaround:** Net operating cash flow significantly improved to an inflow of S\$3.6 million in FY2024, reversing an outflow of S\$4.5 million in FY2023 (Table 2.5). This is a critical positive development, indicating the business is starting to generate cash from its primary activities.
*   **Investing Activities Outflow:** The Group incurred S\$5.1 million in net cash outflow from investing activities (FY2023: S\$2.0 million), largely due to increased capital expenditure of S\$6.9 million for factory equipment and machinery (Table 2.5). This investment is necessary for the strategic shift towards high-precision manufacturing but consumes cash.
*   **Overall Cash Decline:** Despite the positive operating cash flow, the net effect of investing and financing activities led to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of S\$1.2 million (FY2023: S\$14.4 million) (Table 2.5). This trend, if sustained without achieving overall profitability, could eventually deplete cash reserves.

### 2.0 Governance and Risk Analysis

#### 2.1 Qualified Audit Opinion: A Major Red Flag
The most critical disclosure is the **Qualified Opinion** from external auditors Baker Tilly TFW LLP (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 104). The qualification specifically relates to the *ongoing investigation into the affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS)*.
*   **Inability to Determine Financial Impact:** Auditors were unable to determine the potential financial impact of "Claims" pertaining to FYSCS, including alleged misuse of resources and a pre-paid commission of US\$2,984,501 (approx. S\$4 million) (Table 3.32). This uncertainty undermines the reliability of the financial statements, particularly for the discontinued operations.
*   **Internal Control Weaknesses:** The internal audit report highlighted "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management process (Table 3.32), leading to the appointment of external professionals for further investigation. While management states these issues are "isolated solely to FYSCS" and "do not impact our continuing operations" (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6), the audit committee and management themselves *cannot provide assurance on the adequacy of internal controls for the Supply Chain Management Services Segment* (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 99). This represents a severe lapse in governance for that segment and indicates that the risk framework was not adequately applied or effective.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The investigation, combined with the qualified audit opinion, will severely impact the Group's reputation and investor confidence, potentially hindering future financing or business partnerships. The Chairman's message attempting to downplay it as "isolated" is challenged by the auditors' inability to conclude.

#### 2.2 Impairment Charges: Recognizing Past Problems
*   **Goodwill Impairment:** Goodwill of S\$3.2 million from the SCMS segment was fully impaired in FY2024 (Table 3.7) due to the decision to cease operations. This charge significantly contributed to the overall net loss. In FY2023, there was already an impairment loss of S\$2.7 million on goodwill for the same segment. This highlights the poor performance and ultimate failure of the SCMS acquisition and its operations.
*   **PPE Impairment:** An impairment loss of S\$579k on property, plant and equipment was recognized for a China subsidiary (Table 3.4) due to its recoverable amount being lower than carrying value. While less material than goodwill, it points to underperforming assets within the manufacturing segment, specifically in China.

#### 2.3 Environmental and Social Performance: Mixed Results
*   **Positive Environmental Trends:** The Group shows some positive environmental trends: decreased electricity consumption (-2.5%), decreased water consumption (-9.1%), and a significant 25.7% reduction in hazardous waste produced (Table 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7). The installation of solar panels and efforts to use eco-friendly materials are commendable initiatives.
*   **GHG Emissions Target Missed:** While total GHG emissions decreased by 1.1% (Table 1.5), the short-term target to reduce Scope 2 emissions by 3.0% was only achieved at 1.4% (Table 1.5). This indicates a gap between ambition and execution in carbon reduction.
*   **Employee Dynamics:** Total employees decreased from 1,488 in FY2023 to 1,372 in FY2024 (Table 1.8), likely due to the cessation of SCMS. The turnover rate, at 24.9% for FY2024 (Table 1.9), is substantial, though lower than the restated 63.8% in FY2023. The decrease in average training hours per employee (from 16.0 to 13.2 hours) (Table 1.13) might impact future talent development and retention.
*   **Workplace Safety:** An increase in recordable work-related injuries (from 13 cases in FY2023 to 14 in FY2024, with rate increasing from 3.5 to 4.6 per million man-hours) (Table 1.15) is a concern, despite stated zero fatalities. This warrants closer attention to safety protocols.

### 3.0 Business Insights and Implications

*   **Strategic Validation (Manufacturing):** The strong growth and improved margins in the manufacturing segment, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, validate the strategic decision to refocus resources. The increased order book (+20% year-on-year) and new project wins (medical, consumer) are positive forward indicators for this core business.
*   **The Cost of Divestment (SCMS):** The financial and reputational fallout from the SCMS segment (impairment, investigation, qualified audit) is significant. While a necessary step for long-term health, it creates immediate headwinds for trust and perceived financial stability. The \$1.67 million arbitral tribunal ruling against FYSCS (Table 3.33) adds another financial burden from this discontinued operation.
*   **Cash Management Challenges:** Despite improved operating cash flow, the overall cash position is shrinking due to substantial capital expenditures. Management must ensure that investments in the Smart Factory and new machinery translate rapidly into higher, profitable revenue streams to reverse this trend.
*   **Human Capital Risk:** The high turnover, coupled with reduced training hours, could pose a risk to the availability of a skilled workforce, which is critical for high-precision manufacturing. The Board diversity lacks female representation (0% in FY2024) (Table 1.10), indicating a need for improvement in broader diversity metrics beyond just gender.
*   **Governance Under Scrutiny:** The ongoing FYSCS investigation will continue to cast a shadow, impacting investor perception and possibly raising questions about past due diligence processes related to acquisitions. Timely and transparent updates will be crucial.
*   **Outlook vs. Reality:** The management's optimistic outlook for FY2025 (improved financial performance, increased order book) is heavily contingent on the successful ramp-up of new manufacturing projects and the ability to contain further fallout from the FYSCS issues. The geopolitical landscape and supply chain disruptions remain external challenges.

### Conclusion

Fu Yu is at a pivotal juncture. Its core manufacturing business is demonstrating a compelling turnaround, but the legacy issues from the discontinued SCMS segment are substantial. The qualified audit opinion is a significant impediment to market trust. Future success hinges on management's ability to not only drive manufacturing growth and efficiency but also to navigate the FYSCS investigation transparently, effectively mitigate its financial and reputational impacts, and ensure robust internal controls across all continuing operations. Continuous monitoring of cash flows, operational safety, and talent management will be key to converting the manufacturing segment's positive momentum into sustainable Group-level profitability.
