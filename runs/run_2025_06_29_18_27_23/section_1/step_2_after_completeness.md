## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

Maxis Berhad (Maxis) demonstrates a comprehensive and strategically aligned operating footprint, primarily concentrated within Malaysia, designed to support its position as a leading integrated telecommunications provider. The company's physical and human resources are distributed to maximize network coverage, enhance customer experience, and drive digital transformation across its core Mobile, Home, and Enterprise segments.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions

Maxis' human capital is a critical component of its operating footprint, with a focus on skill development and well-being.

**Employee Headcount & Demographics:**
*   **Total Employees:**
    *   **2022:** 4,078 employees [AR 2024, p.42, "Total number of employees" table]
    *   **2023:** 3,803 employees [AR 2024, p.42, "Total number of employees" table]
    *   **2024:** 3,288 employees [AR 2024, p.42, "Total number of employees" table]. This represents a significant reduction in workforce over the last three years, indicating ongoing "staff and resource cost optimisation exercise" [AR 2024, p.135, Note 7].
*   **Gender Distribution (Permanent & Contract Employees):**
    *   **2022:** 43% Female, 55% Male (Permanent); 1% Female, 1% Male (Contract) [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Permanent & Contract Employees and Gender Breakdown" table]
    *   **2023:** 42% Female, 56% Male (Permanent); 1% Female, 1% Male (Contract) [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Permanent & Contract Employees and Gender Breakdown" table]
    *   **2024:** 41% Female, 57% Male (Permanent); 1% Female, 1% Male (Contract) [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Permanent & Contract Employees and Gender Breakdown" table]. The proportion of female employees has slightly decreased.
*   **Employee Category (Gender Breakdown):**
    *   **Senior Management:**
        *   **2022:** 74.6% Male, 25.4% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2023:** 74.5% Male, 25.5% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2024:** 73.8% Male, 26.2% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
    *   **Managers:**
        *   **2022:** 62.6% Male, 37.4% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2023:** 61.9% Male, 38.1% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2024:** 62.2% Male, 37.8% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
    *   **Individual Contributors (IC):**
        *   **2022:** 55.3% Male, 44.7% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2023:** 56.2% Male, 43.8% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2024:** 56.8% Male, 43.2% Female [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Gender for Each Employee Category" table]. This shows a consistent male dominance in senior and managerial roles.
*   **Age Group (Percentage of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category):**
    *   **Below 30:**
        *   **2022:** 0.6% (Managers), 17.0% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2023:** 0.6% (Managers), 15.3% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2024:** 0.2% (Managers), 13.0% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
    *   **30-49:**
        *   **2022:** 47.3% (Senior Management), 79.2% (Managers), 74.2% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2023:** 43.1% (Senior Management), 78.4% (Managers), 76.0% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2024:** 45.2% (Senior Management), 76.1% (Managers), 76.1% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]. The majority of employees fall within this age bracket across all categories.
    *   **50 and above:**
        *   **2022:** 52.7% (Senior Management), 20.2% (Managers), 8.8% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2023:** 56.9% (Senior Management), 21.0% (Managers), 8.7% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
        *   **2024:** 54.8% (Senior Management), 23.7% (Managers), 10.9% (IC) [AR 2024, p.45, "Percentage (%) of Employees by Age Group for Each Employee Category" table]
*   **Employees with Disability:**
    *   **2022:** 4 employees (0.10%) [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Employees with Disability" table]
    *   **2023:** 6 employees (0.17%) [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Employees with Disability" table]
    *   **2024:** 4 employees (0.11%) [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Employees with Disability" table]. Maxis continues its "Visually Impaired Agent Programme," integrating nine individuals in 2024 [AR 2024, p.44].
*   **Employee Turnover (Total Employees):**
    *   **2022:** 609 employees [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Employee Turnover by Employee Category" table]
    *   **2023:** 696 employees [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Employee Turnover by Employee Category" table]
    *   **2024:** 572 employees [AR 2024, p.45, "Number of Employee Turnover by Employee Category" table]. While the absolute number decreased, this needs to be viewed in context of the overall reduction in headcount. The reduction in staff costs (RM839M in 2024 vs RM880M in 2023) [AR 2024, p.134, Note 7] is partly attributed to "manpower rationalization cost" in FY2023 [24Q4 TS, p.18].

**Training and Development:**
*   **Total Training Hours (for employees only):**
    *   **2022:** 111,743 hours [AR 2024, p.42, "Total Training Hours by Employee Category (contribution level)" table]
    *   **2023:** 98,461 hours [AR 2024, p.42, "Total Training Hours by Employee Category (contribution level)" table]
    *   **2024:** 80,169 hours (86,878 including contingent workers) [AR 2024, p.42, "Total Training Hours" table]. This translates to an average of 24.38 hours per employee in 2024, a decrease from 25.99 hours in 2023 and 32.06 hours in 2022 [AR 2024, p.42, "Employee Learning Hours" table].
*   **GenAI Academy:** Trained over 2,000 employees in AI fundamentals in 2024 [AR 2024, p.42].
*   **Locations:** While employees are primarily distributed across the registered office at Menara Maxis, Kuala Lumpur, and various regional offices and technical operation centres [AR 2024, p.3, "Corporate Information"; p.197, "List of Properties Held"], specific quantitative breakdowns of employee distribution by geographic location or functional department (e.g., Network Operations, Sales, Customer Service, IT, HR, Finance) are not disclosed in the available reports.

The reduction in employee headcount and average training hours, while contributing to cost optimization, poses a potential non-financial risk to employee morale and long-term skill development, especially in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Management's claim of "high-performing organisation" (AR 2024, p.3) should be continuously monitored against these trends.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

Maxis' primary geographic footprint is Malaysia, where it operates nationwide, aligning with its vision to be "The Leading Integrated Telco in Malaysia" and its purpose to "connect people and businesses to a world of possibilities" [AR 2024, p.11].

*   **Nationwide Coverage:** Achieved 96% 4G population coverage and 82.4% 5G population coverage in 2024 [AR 2024, p.3, p.28]. This extensive reach is critical for serving a broad customer base across urban and underserved areas.
*   **Strategic Partnerships:**
    *   **Sarawak Digital Economy Corporation (2024):** Partnership to expand connectivity and empower the local workforce with digital skills, aligning with the Sarawak Digital Economy Blueprint 2030 [AR 2024, p.5]. This demonstrates a targeted approach to regional digital transformation.
    *   **Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB):** Maxis holds a 0.02% equity interest in DNB and has advanced RM233.2 million for products and services, with potential for a dual 5G network model [AR 2024, p.149, Note 21]. This is a significant development for future 5G infrastructure and service delivery across Malaysia.
*   **International Presence:** Revenue from "Other countries" (primarily roaming business) accounted for RM220 million in 2024, a small portion of total revenue [AR 2024, p.133, Note 5]. This suggests a strong domestic focus.

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

Maxis has undergone several significant changes and trends in its operating footprint, driven by technological advancements, market competition, and strategic priorities.

*   **Workforce Reduction:** A notable trend is the consistent reduction in employee headcount from 4,078 in 2022 to 3,288 in 2024 [AR 2024, p.42]. This "manpower rationalization" [24Q4 TS, p.18] is part of "cost discipline and operational efficiency" efforts.
*   **Network Modernization and Expansion:**
    *   **3G Network Shutdown:** Deactivated outdated 3G equipment and upgraded to 4G/5G technology, reducing operational costs and environmental impact [AR 2024, p.36].
    *   **5G Expansion:** Rapid increase in 5G device subscriptions (3.7 million in 2024, 50% growth YoY from 2.47 million in 2023) and 5G penetration (38% in 2024 vs 27% in 2023) [AR 2024, p.27]. (2022 data for 5G device subscriptions and penetration is not available in the source documents).
    *   **Fibre Rollout:** Continuous expansion of fibre footprint and home connections, reflecting a commitment to fixed broadband growth [AR 2024, p.31].
    *   **Accelerated Depreciation:** Maxis accelerated depreciation of certain telecommunications equipment (RM5 million impact in 2024, RM121 million in 2023) due to future network upgrades [AR 2024, p.143, Note 15]. This indicates planned asset replacements and technological refreshes.
*   **Digitalization and AI Adoption:**
    *   **SAP S4/HANA Transition:** Successful transition to a new ERP system in 1Q25, streamlining processes [AR 2024, p.7; 25Q1 TS, p.2].
    *   **AI Platform Deployment:** "Dexter," Maxis' homegrown AI assistant, is deployed in contact centers, improving first-contact resolution and reducing handling times [AR 2024, p.29]. AI-powered diagnostic tools are also trialed for fibre fault detection [AR 2024, p.32].
    *   **Self-Service Adoption:** Significant acceleration in digital self-service, with 1 in 4 postpaid customers completing contracting/upgrading digitally and >80% of prepaid internet purchases via app (2024) [AR 2024, p.27].
*   **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**
    *   **Historical CAPEX (RM million):**
        *   1Q25: 86 [25Q1 FS, p.16]
        *   4Q24: 313 [24Q4 FS, p.16]
        *   3Q24: 140 [25Q1 Pres, p.14]
        *   2Q24: 116 [25Q1 Pres, p.14]
        *   1Q24: 106 [25Q1 Pres, p.14]
        *   2024: 675 [24Q4 FS, p.16]
        *   2023: 813 [24Q4 FS, p.16]
        *   2022: 674 [AR 2024, p.3, "CAPEX Investment"]
    *   CAPEX decreased by 17% in 2024 compared to 2023 [24Q4 FS, p.17]. Management states this reflects a "prudent approach" and "strategic focus on essential upgrades and futureproofing its integrated network" [24Q4 FS, p.17]. The Q1 2025 CAPEX is notably lower (RM86M) than previous quarters, with management reiterating focus on "prioritising Capex investments that align with long-term strategic goals" and "optimise existing infrastructure" [25Q1 Pres, p.9]. This sustained reduction in CAPEX, while presented as strategic, could be a red flag for future network capacity or quality if not managed carefully. The non-financial risk here is potential customer service degradation or inability to keep pace with demand if underinvestment occurs.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Maxis' operating structure is designed to leverage its extensive network and digital capabilities to enhance competitive positioning.

*   **Network Leadership:** Maintaining 96% 4G coverage and rapidly expanding 5G coverage (82.4% in 2024) positions Maxis as a leader in connectivity [AR 2024, p.3, p.28]. This is a core differentiator in a competitive market.
*   **Customer Experience (CX) Focus:**
    *   High Net Promoter Score (+70 in 2024) and awards for contact center operations, including being "among the Top 20 Leading CX Companies in Malaysia" and earning the "Platinum Award for Best Contact Centre Operations in the APAC Region in 2024" [AR 2024, p.3, p.28]. This is supported by digital self-service, AI integration (Dexter), and omnichannel support [AR 2024, p.29].
    *   Proactive network notifications and improved digital complaint management system enhance transparency and reduce queries [AR 2024, p.29].
    *   Maxpert Quality Framework ensures high standards in technical service delivery for home connectivity [AR 2024, p.32].

            *   **2023:** 1,688 (1,669 Network, 19 Office) [AR 2024, p.37, "Energy Consumption" table]
            *   **2024:** 1,691 (1,673 Network, 18 Office) [AR 2024, p.37, "Energy Consumption" table]. Despite an increase in network sites, network energy consumption only increased by 0.25% in 2024, leading to "lower network site emissions intensity" and "savings in electricity costs" [AR 2024, p.37].
    *   **Waste Management:**
        *   **Total Waste Generated (tonnes):**
            *   **2022:** Data not available in source [AR 2024, p.39, "Waste Generated, Diverted from Disposal and Directed to Disposal" table]
            *   **2023:** Data not available in source [AR 2024, p.39, "Waste Generated, Diverted from Disposal and Directed to Disposal" table]
            *   **2024:** 583.06 tonnes [AR 2024, p.39, "Waste Generated, Diverted from Disposal and Directed to Disposal" table]
        *   **Waste Reused/Recycled (tonnes):**
            *   **2022:** 0.26 tonnes [AR 2024, p.39, "Waste Generated, Diverted from Disposal and Directed to Disposal" table]
            *   **2023:** 0.46 tonnes [AR 2024, p.39, "Waste Generated, Diverted from Disposal and Directed to Disposal" table]
            *   **2024:** 455.97 tonnes (78% recycling rate for total waste) [AR 2024, p.39, "Waste Generated, Diverted from Disposal and Directed to Disposal" table]. This includes network equipment recycling (88% rate in 2024).
        *   **E-Waste Management (Total Items Collected - units):**
            *   **2022:** Data not available in source [AR 2024, p.40, "E-Waste Collection" table]
            *   **2023:** 22,704 items [AR 2024, p.40, "E-Waste Collection" table]
            *   **2024:** 22,239 items [AR 2024, p.40, "E-Waste Collection" table].
    *   **Water Management:**
        *   **Total Water Consumption (m3):**
            *   **2022:** Data unavailable, as Maxis began measuring water consumption from 2023 onwards [AR 2024, p.40, "Total Water Consumption (m3)" table]
            *   **2023:** 43,225 m3 [AR 2024, p.40, "Total Water Consumption (m3)" table]
            *   **2024:** 56,968 m3 [AR 2024, p.40, "Total Water Consumption (m3)" table]. The document notes "limited visibility of source data" and a "methodology change applied during the year," which could be a red flag for data reliability or consistency in this area.
    *   **Operational Optimization:** Initiatives like reducing unnecessary "truck rolls" for fibre installations and improving Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) for service restoration contribute to efficiency and cost savings [AR 2024, p.32, p.29].
*   **Capacity Management:** Offloading >20% of total traffic from 4G to 5G optimizes network efficiency and balances traffic [AR 2024, p.28]. This enhances network performance without necessarily requiring extensive new infrastructure, thus improving unit cost per GB.
*   **Human Capital Efficiency:** The reduction in employee headcount (as noted in section a) directly impacts staff costs, contributing to improved EBITDA margins. However, the sustainability of these cost reductions hinges on avoiding long-term operational impairment, such as reduced service quality or employee morale issues, which are non-financial risks that need careful monitoring. While management highlights "disciplined cost management" (CEO's statement, p.7), the impact of reduced training hours and headcount on long-term operational viability and innovation should be critically assessed.

**Overall Insight:** Maxis' operating footprint reflects a strategic pivot towards a more efficient, digitally-driven model. While management emphasizes "sustainable growth" and "operational excellence" with supporting data on cost savings and network performance, the notable reduction in CAPEX and employee training hours warrants close attention. These trends, if not balanced with sufficient investment in future capabilities and human capital development, could pose long-term non-financial risks to competitive positioning and customer satisfaction, potentially impacting future unit economics.
