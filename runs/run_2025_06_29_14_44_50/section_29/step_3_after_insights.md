## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Overall operating performance for Fu Yu Corporation Limited's (the "Company" or "Fu Yu") core manufacturing segment has shown a positive trajectory over the last 24 months, particularly in the most recent financial year. Driven by strategic transformation initiatives, the manufacturing business has demonstrated robust revenue growth, significant gross profit margin (GPM) expansion, and a strong increase in its order book. This indicates an improving operational efficiency and market traction in its high-precision manufacturing capabilities, crucial given the strategic discontinuation of its supply chain management (SCM) services, which significantly masked Group-level growth.

This analysis focuses on the three most important operating metrics that materially impacted Fu Yu's economic performance over the last 24 months: **Manufacturing Revenue**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **Order Book Growth**. These metrics reflect the Company's market traction, pricing power, cost efficiency, and future revenue potential in its core business. While some of these metrics appear on financial statements, our analysis focuses on their underlying operational drivers and implications. A key limitation for buy-side due diligence is the absence of quantifiable market share, comprehensive asset utilization rates (beyond energy intensity, discussed under GPM), and direct industry benchmarks from public documents. This severely limits external comparative analysis and the ability to definitively assess Fu Yu's competitive positioning or relative efficiency. For a B2B contract manufacturer like Fu Yu, metrics such as revenue per user, customer acquisition costs, and customer churn/retention are less directly quantifiable from public disclosures, though "Higher Order Volumes from Existing Customers" (discussed under Manufacturing Revenue) provides qualitative insight into customer retention.

### 1. Manufacturing Revenue

**Definition and Relevance:** Manufacturing Revenue represents the total sales generated by the Company's core business of producing and assembling high-precision plastic and metal components and products. It is a critical operating metric as it directly reflects the Company's ability to secure and fulfill customer orders, indicating market demand for its products and the effectiveness of its sales and new product introduction (NPI) strategies. It is a direct measure of volumes and unit pricing achieved.

**Benchmarking:** The provided documents do not offer specific competitor or industry average data for manufacturing revenue. Therefore, direct quantitative benchmarking is not possible within the scope of this analysis. However, the Company's 10.5% year-on-year growth in manufacturing revenue for FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6] indicates a positive trend within its operational context. This growth was vital in offsetting the SCM segment's decline, resulting in only a marginal 0.5% overall Group revenue increase [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 7].

**Analysis of Drivers:** The growth in manufacturing revenue is primarily driven by:
*   **Higher Order Volumes from Existing Customers:** This suggests strong customer relationships and satisfaction. While the Company highlights increased volumes, a precise quantitative breakdown between volume increases and pricing adjustments is not provided in the available documents, which is a key area for further due diligence.
*   **New Project Wins:** Significant new projects were secured in higher-margin product categories, including biomedical, medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. This indicates successful diversification and penetration into high-growth sectors.
*   **Strategic Transformation:** The Company's investment in advanced tooling and the introduction of its New Product Introduction ("NPI") team have enabled these project wins [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6].
*   **Geographical Shift:** Increased sales from Singapore (+20.9% to S$46.2 million in FY2024) and Malaysia (+24.9% to S$36.6 million in FY2024) operations offset a decline in China operations (-11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024), reflecting a strategic move to source production away from China amid geopolitical uncertainties [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 8]. While presented as a strategic de-risking move, the analysis lacks clarity on whether the China decline implies customer attrition (i.e., loss of relationships) or merely a relocation of existing customer production away from China to Fu Yu's other facilities. This distinction is critical for assessing true customer stickiness and market share evolution.

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** The current growth trend appears sustainable given the "sticky" nature of high-precision tooling projects, which are expected to translate into long-term revenue [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. The focus on high-precision products and the establishment of the Smart Factory in Singapore further support this. However, geopolitical uncertainties and a slower-than-expected recovery in China's economy could pose headwinds, as evidenced by the decline in China's revenue contribution. The Company's diversification strategy aims to mitigate this risk.

**Quantified Financial Impact:** The 10.5% increase in manufacturing revenue from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024 directly contributed S$11.0 million to the Group's topline growth [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. This growth in the core segment was crucial in offsetting the decline from the discontinued supply chain management services, resulting in a slight overall Group revenue increase of 0.5% [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 7].

**Due Diligence Questions:**
*   What is the weighted average contract length or expected revenue lifespan for the new high-precision projects that have transitioned to mass production in FY2024, and what is the projected revenue contribution from these specific projects for FY2025 and FY2026?
*   Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing revenue growth between volume increases from existing customers, new customer acquisition, and pricing adjustments over the last 24 months? This is crucial for assessing revenue quality.
*   Does the decline in China operations represent customer attrition or a strategic shift of existing customers' production away from China to Fu Yu's other facilities?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Definition and Relevance:** Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin is the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold for the manufacturing segment. This metric is crucial as it indicates the Company's pricing power, cost efficiency in production, and overall unit economics. An expanding margin suggests effective cost control, improved operational efficiency, or a shift towards higher-value products.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months, Half-Yearly):**

| Period     | Manufacturing Gross Profit (S$ million) | Manufacturing GPM (%) | HoH GPM Δ (pp) | YoY GPM Δ (pp) | Source (Fu Yu FS Q424, unless specified)                 |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1H2023     | 9.21                                    | 17.5                  | -              | -              | Page 4 (Rev), Page 6 (CoS)                               |

| **FY2024** | **23.15**                               | **20.3**              | -              | +2.8           | Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6 (Revenue & GPM; CoS calculated)      |

*CoS = Cost of Sales; GP = Gross Profit. GP calculated as Rev - CoS for half-yearly, and Rev * GPM% for full-year based on stated sources.*

**Analysis of Drivers:** Manufacturing GPM expanded significantly from 17.5% in FY2023 to 20.3% in FY2024, a 2.8 percentage point increase that materially boosted gross profit by S$5.03 million. This expansion is primarily attributed to an improved product mix towards higher-value, higher-margin projects, aligning with the revenue growth drivers. It is important to note a discrepancy between these calculated GPM figures and those explicitly stated in the Fu Yu 24 AR (page 7), which reports manufacturing GPM increasing from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024. This divergence in reported percentages and underlying gross profit figures (S$12.1 million to S$15.5 million per AR text vs. S$18.12 million to S$23.15 million per detailed table calculations) is a significant analytical gap that warrants immediate clarification during due diligence.

While claims of operational efficiency gains (e.g., reduced energy intensity due to automation, labour optimization, higher machinery utilization) [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6] are positive, they lack specific quantification. This prevents independent verification of their actual impact on margins. Similarly, while "pricing power" is cited, its contribution is not explicitly broken down in the revenue figures, creating an analytical gap regarding how this power is being realized. Most critically, the assertion that production costs are *lower* in Malaysia and Singapore compared to China for the current product mix is highly counter-intuitive for manufacturing, as China is typically associated with lower overall manufacturing costs. This claim demands deep investigation into its underlying logic, whether it's related to tax incentives, a shift to higher automation outside China, or specific supply chain advantages for their niche products. Without granular cost breakdowns by region and product line, this remains a significant analytical gap and potential red flag for a buyer.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
*   Can management quantify specific cost savings from automation, labour optimization, and reduced energy intensity, providing historical data (e.g., energy consumption per unit, labour cost per unit, or capacity utilization rates)?
*   How are production costs in Singapore and Malaysia lower than China for the current product mix? Provide granular breakdown of labour, raw material, and overhead costs by region and product line.
*   What is the specific evidence of increased pricing power, and how does this translate into a quantifiable price component in revenue growth?

### 3. Order Book Growth

**Definition and Relevance:** Order book growth reflects the value of confirmed customer orders yet to be fulfilled. It is a forward-looking indicator of future revenue potential and market demand, indicating the Company's ability to convert sales efforts into tangible future business.

**Analysis of Drivers:** Fu Yu reports a "strong increase in order book" with "new project wins expected to transition into long-term revenue streams" [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. Specifically, the order book at the end of FY2024 has increased 20% year-on-year [Fu Yu 24 AR, page 6]. This qualitative and quantitative growth is driven by new project wins in high-growth sectors, deepening customer relationships, and strategic geographical diversification. However, while the 20% growth rate is noted, no further quantifiable data (monetary value, volume, or duration) is provided in public documents. This represents a critical analytical limitation for buy-side due diligence, preventing independent verification of future revenue visibility and the "highly sustainable" nature claimed by the Company. Without specific figures (e.g., total monetary value of the order book), its true financial impact and future contribution remain speculative, constituting a significant red flag that a buyer must prioritize investigating.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
*   Can management provide a quantified breakdown of the current order book by value, customer type (new vs. existing), key product category, and expected revenue recognition timeline (e.g., 12-month, 24-month, 36-month pipeline)?
*   What are the typical cancellation rates for these high-precision manufacturing orders, and how do they compare to industry averages?
*   What is the average contract length/revenue lifespan for "long-term revenue streams," and what proportion of the current order book is attributable to such contracts?
