This appendix is a robust attempt to compile a comprehensive data reference. It excels in its core mission of focusing purely on data and is well-sourced, which is crucial for an appendix. However, several formatting and organizational improvements would significantly enhance its utility as a "clean data reference tool."

Here's a detailed critique based on your criteria:

### Critique Summary

**Strengths:**

*   **Pure Data Focus (Excellent):** The appendix successfully avoids analytical narratives, insights, or "What-Why-So What" content. It is truly a collection of raw data tables, which aligns perfectly with the stated goal.
*   **Data Integrity (Appears Comprehensive):** The sheer volume and specificity of the tables suggest a thorough extraction from the source documents. It covers a wide range of operational, financial, governance, and miscellaneous data points. Each table is diligently sourced, which is excellent for verifiability.

**Areas for Improvement (with Recommendations):**

**1. Table Organization:**

*   **General Structure:** The overarching sections (Operational KPIs, Consolidated Financials, Supporting Financials, Shareholder & Governance Data, Miscellaneous) are logical and well-sequenced.
*   **Recommendation (Minor Relocation):** Consider moving the detailed income statement components (e.g., "Other Income", "Other Expenses", "Finance Costs", "Selected Components of Loss for the Year", "Profit/(Loss) Before Income Tax (Continuing Operations)", "Tax Expense/(Credit) (Group)", "Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate (Group)") from **Section 3 (Supporting Financials)** to **Section 2 (Consolidated Financials)**. While "Supporting" implies detail, these are direct breakdowns and reconciliations of the main income statement, making them more cohesive with the primary financial statements in Section 2. Section 3 could then focus purely on balance sheet notes (PPE, Inventories, Receivables, etc.) and risk management.

**2. Clean Format:**

This is the area with the most significant opportunities for improvement, particularly concerning very wide or nested tables.

*   **Recommendation (Major - Split Financial Statements):**
    *   **`Condensed Interim Statements of Financial Position (Unaudited)` (Section 2):** This table attempts to combine "Group" and "Company" financials side-by-side using four columns but only populates two at a time, leading to large blank spaces and visual confusion. **Split this into two separate tables:** one for "Group" and one for "Company", each with two columns for the financial years. This will dramatically improve readability.

*   **Recommendation (Major - Split Segment Reporting Tables):**
    *   **`Disaggregation of Revenue from Contracts with Customers` (Section 4):** This table is excessively wide and attempts to combine "Six Months Ended 31 Dec" and "Twelve Months Ended 31 Dec" periods within the same table, creating a very dense and difficult-to-read format. **Split this into at least two distinct tables**, one for each reporting period. Further consideration could be given to splitting by segment if the individual segment data remains too wide.
    *   **`Operating Segments - Segments` (Section 4):** Similar to the revenue disaggregation, this table is overwhelming due to its width and the combination of two reporting periods and multiple segments. **This table must be split** into smaller, more manageable tables (e.g., separate tables for "Six Months Ended 31 Dec" and "Twelve Months Ended 31 Dec").

*   **Recommendation (Minor - Add Missing Legends/Footnotes):** Several tables use symbols or numbers (`^`, `*`, `(1)`, `(2)`, `+`, `#`) without corresponding legends or footnotes. This is critical for data clarity and interpretation.
    *   **Section 1:** `Corporate ISO and QS Certification`: Add a legend for the `^` symbol (e.g., "Certified").
    *   **Section 3:** `Financial Risk Management - Accounting Classification and Fair Values`: Add legends for `+` and `#` footnotes.
    *   **Section 5:**
        *   `Remuneration Paid to or Accrued for Each Director`: Add footnote for `*` next to Hew Lien Lee.
        *   `Remuneration Paid to or Accrued for Key Management Personnel`, `Remuneration of Immediate Family Members of GCEO`, `Remuneration of Substantial Shareholder`: Add footnote for `(1)` (e.g., indicating the number of personnel).
        *   `Directors' Interests`: Add footnote for `(1)` next to Seow Jun Hao David.
    *   **Section 6:** `List of Entities Included in This Report`: Add a legend for `âˆš` and `N`.
    *   **Section 6:** `Subsidiaries - Details of Subsidiaries`: Add footnotes for `(1)` and `(2)`.

*   **Recommendation (Minor - Improve Clarity of Nested Categories):**
    *   **`Waste Diverted from Disposal (FY2024)` and `Waste Directed to Disposal (FY2024)` (Section 1):** The current formatting for nested categories (e.g., "Hazardous Waste" containing "Commercial and industrial waste") is visually ambiguous due to blank cells in the main category column. Improve alignment and add bolded subtotals for clearer visual hierarchy.
        *   **Example (for Waste Diverted, Hazardous Waste):**
            ```
            | Waste Diverted from Disposal (FY2024) |                                 | Tonne |
            |:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:------|
            | Hazardous Waste                       | Commercial and industrial waste | 34.2  |
            |                                       | WEEE - mixed                    | 0.6   |
            |                                       | **Total Hazardous Waste**       | **34.8**|
            ```

*   **Recommendation (Minor - Clarify Gearing Ratio):**
    *   **`Financial Highlights - Key Financial Ratios` (Section 2):** The "Gearing" row currently shows "Net Cash" twice instead of numerical values. Clarify if "Net Cash" is the *type* of gearing being measured or if the values are simply missing. Provide the actual numerical ratio if available, or explain the "Net Cash" context.

*   **Recommendation (Minor - Reduce Header Verbosity):**
    *   Some column headers use `<br>` tags extensively (e.g., `tCO2<br>e`, `Total<br>Number of<br>Employees`, `Increase /<br>(Decrease) %`, `Data disclosed in Material Factors<br>Economic<br>Performance`). While functional in Markdown, consider if slight rephrasing or conciseness could improve readability without losing meaning. For the "Material Factors" table, for instance, a single "Material Factors Disclosure" column with checkmarks/N's and a clear legend would be much cleaner.

*   **Recommendation (Minor - Consistent Formatting for Simple Lists):**
    *   **Section 5 (Shareholder & Governance Data):** Simple lists like `Board of Directors Composition`, `Executive Director`, `Non-Executive Directors`, `Audit Committee`, etc., are currently bulleted. For stricter consistency with the rest of the appendix's tabular format, consider converting these to simple, single-column Markdown tables. This is an aesthetic choice but contributes to a "clean format."

**3. Reference Utility:**

*   **Overall:** The appendix has a strong foundation for reference utility due to its pure data focus and comprehensive sourcing. However, the identified formatting issues (especially the overly wide and combined tables) significantly hinder quick and easy data lookup.
*   **Impact of Recommendations:** Implementing the splitting of large tables (Recommendations 2, 3, 4) will drastically improve the appendix's usability as a quick reference tool, allowing users to scan and extract specific data points much more efficiently. Adding missing legends/footnotes (Recommendation 5) is also crucial for accurate data interpretation.

### Conclusion

This appendix is off to an excellent start with its clear data focus and robust sourcing. By addressing the critical formatting issues, particularly the splitting of large and complex tables, and adding the missing legends/footnotes, it will transform from a comprehensive data dump into a truly "clean data reference tool" that is both easy to navigate and highly useful.
