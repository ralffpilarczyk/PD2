The analysis of Fu Yu's consolidated financial performance is based on the provided facts for the last two financial years, FY2023 and FY2024. No data for a third financial year, five most recent interim periods, or any forecasts/guidance were available in the provided facts. Consequently, trend analysis and performance assessment will be limited to the observed changes between these two periods. Similarly, no information on Capex, Cash Conversion, GAAP/non-GAAP measures, one-time items, or industry comparisons was provided, which limits the scope of the analysis.

**Key Recent Trends:**

*   **Revenue Growth:** The company saw a healthy increase in revenue from continuing operations, growing by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, up from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [FACT: Revenue for continuing operations grew 10.5% from S$103.9 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This indicates positive top-line momentum for the core business.
*   **Profitability Turnaround in Continuing Operations:** There was a significant turnaround in the profitability of continuing operations. EBITDA from continuing operations surged from S$0.6 million in FY2023 to S$8.5 million in FY2024 [FACT: EBITDA from Continuing Operations was S$8.5 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9], resulting in a substantial increase in EBITDA margin from 0.58% to 7.40%. Similarly, operating profit from continuing operations swung from a loss of S$(7.3) million in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.4 million in FY2024 [FACT: Operating Profit/(Loss) from Continuing Operations was S$0.4 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9], and the loss from continuing operations narrowed significantly by 84.2% to S$(1.2) million [FACT: Loss from Continuing Operations narrowed by 84.2%] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9].
*   **Persistent Overall Net Loss:** Despite the strong improvements in continuing operations, the company reported a consolidated Net Loss of S$(3.9) million in FY2024, albeit narrowed by 61.4% from S$(10.1) million in FY2023 [FACT: Net Loss was S$(3.9) million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This persistent loss is primarily attributable to the increasing losses from discontinued operations.
*   **Discontinued Operations as a Drag:** Losses from discontinued operations increased by 32.0% from S$(2.5) million in FY2023 to S$(3.3) million in FY2024 [FACT: Loss from Discontinued Operations increased by 32.0%] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9], offsetting some of the gains from continuing operations.

**Margin Analysis:**

*   **Gross Profit Margin:** Improved by 1.8 percentage points, from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024 [FACT: Gross Profit Margin for continuing operations improved by 1.8 percentage points] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This indicates better cost management or more favorable pricing in the core business.
*   **EBITDA Margin:** A dramatic increase from 0.58% to 7.40% for continuing operations highlights significant improvements in operational efficiency and cost control before depreciation and amortization.
*   **Operating Margin:** The swing from -7.03% to 0.35% for continuing operations is a critical indicator of the core business returning to operating profitability.
*   **Net Loss Margin (Consolidated):** While still negative, the consolidated net loss margin improved from -9.72% to -3.39%, primarily driven by the strong performance of continuing operations.

**Cash Flow Assessment:**

*   While a full cash flow statement is not available, the cash and bank balances decreased from S$60.3 million as at 31 Dec 2023 to S$55.5 million as at 31 Dec 2024 [FACT: Cash and bank balances were S$55.5 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This indicates a net cash outflow during the year, despite the improved operational profitability of the continuing business. Factors such as losses from discontinued operations, capital expenditures (if any), debt repayments, or changes in working capital could contribute to this decline.
*   The company's gearing remains "Net Cash" for both FY2023 and FY2024 [FACT: Gearing was Net Cash] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9], which is a positive sign of financial stability and liquidity, despite the reduction in cash balance.

### b. MD&A highlighting key recent trends

**Performance Assessment:**

Given the limited historical data (two years) and absence of guidance or industry benchmarks, the assessment focuses on the internal improvements and challenges observed.

**Key Drivers of Performance:**
The primary driver for the improved financial performance is the strong rebound and efficiency gains within the **continuing operations**. This is evidenced by the significant revenue growth, substantial improvements in gross profit margin, and a decisive turnaround from operating loss to operating profit, leading to a substantial narrowing of the loss from continuing operations.

**2 Key Achievements:**

1.  **Remarkable Turnaround in Continuing Operations' Profitability:** Fu Yu achieved a significant improvement in its core business. Operating profit from continuing operations swung from a loss of S$(7.3) million in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.4 million in FY2024 [FACT: Operating Profit/(Loss) from Continuing Operations was S$0.4 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This was further underscored by an impressive surge in EBITDA from continuing operations from S$0.6 million to S$8.5 million [FACT: EBITDA from Continuing Operations was S$8.5 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9] and a 1.8 percentage point improvement in gross profit margin to 13.5% [FACT: Gross Profit Margin for continuing operations improved by 1.8 percentage points] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9].
2.  **Robust Revenue Growth:** The company successfully grew revenue from continuing operations by 10.5% from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024 [FACT: Revenue for continuing operations grew 10.5% from S$103.9 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This indicates successful top-line expansion in its core business activities, demonstrating market traction and demand.

**2 Key Challenges:**

1.  **Increasing Losses from Discontinued Operations:** Despite the strong performance of continuing operations, the overall consolidated net loss was negatively impacted by a 32.0% increase in losses from discontinued operations, growing from S$(2.5) million in FY2023 to S$(3.3) million in FY2024 [FACT: Loss from Discontinued Operations increased by 32.0%] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. This suggests that the wind-down or divestment of these operations might be more costly or prolonged than anticipated, preventing the company from achieving overall profitability.
2.  **Persistent Consolidated Net Loss and Declining Cash Balance:** Even with significant improvements in continuing operations, the company recorded a consolidated net loss of S$(3.9) million in FY2024 [FACT: Net Loss was S$(3.9) million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9]. Furthermore, cash and bank balances decreased from S$60.3 million to S$55.5 million [FACT: Cash and bank balances were S$55.5 million] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.9], indicating a net cash outflow. While the net cash position provides a buffer, the combination of ongoing consolidated losses and declining cash warrants attention regarding the company's long-term self-sufficiency and funding needs.
