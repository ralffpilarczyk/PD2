# Common critical rules for all OPP sections
OPP_CRITICAL_RULES = """
Critical rules:
• Keep each sentence as concise as possible. no corporate poetry, no consulting buzz words, but chairman-friendly language
• Ideally, each sentence should have at least one number
• Do not make up information
• A precise sentence which may not perfectly suit the purpose is much more valuable than a beautifully tailored sentence which is not grounded
• Format each bullet as: **Title** (1-2 words): Rest of sentence. Example: **Revenues**: In 2024 revenues were USD81m, up 8.5% YoY.
• If there is no meaningful data to write a sentence as instructed, skip it silently - never write a bullet without specifics
• ALWAYS use the most recent data available in the source documents - prioritize latest fiscal periods over historical data

Prose requirements:
• Every bullet must be a complete grammatical sentence with subject and verb
• No sentence fragments or comma-separated lists without connecting words
• Use proper articles (a, the) and conjunctions (and, but, while)
• Readable as standalone prose, not telegraphic shorthand

ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS SECTION:
{section['specs']}

{OPP_CRITICAL_RULES}

CURRENT SECTION CONTENT:
---
{section_content}
---

SOURCE DOCUMENTS:
{{source_documents}}

YOUR DUAL ASSESSMENT:

PART A: DATA COMPLETENESS
Check if the section is missing specific data points from source documents that are required by the ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS above.

PART B: INVESTOR PERSPECTIVE COMPLETENESS
Consider adding statements (but only if they are not already present) underpinned by numbers and supported by source documents if they meet one of the following criteria:
- They fulfill an item in the ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS that was skipped
- They are fundamental to a reader's understanding of the company as an investment or acquisition target
- They are fundamental to the company's prospects

PART C: TEMPORAL COMPLETENESS
Identify any metrics or data points in the current content using data older than the most recent fiscal period available in source documents. Flag for replacement with latest data.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:
ONLY suggest additions where the source documents contain relevant data to support the addition. Do NOT suggest perspective gaps if the source documents lack the necessary data.

SECTION BOUNDARIES - STAY IN SCOPE:
This completeness check is for the "{section['title']}" section ONLY.
Do NOT suggest additions that belong in other sections:
{get_section_boundaries(section['number'])}

MATERIALITY FILTER:
Each addition must pass TWO tests:
1. "Is this data/perspective CRITICAL to evaluating this company as an investment or acquisition target?"
2. "Do the source documents contain sufficient data to support this addition?"

ADD LIST FORMAT:
- [CRITICAL] Missing item that would materially affect investment decision
- [IMPORTANT] Relevant item that would improve completeness
- [USEFUL] Supporting item that adds investor value
- [OUTDATED] Replace [old metric/year] with [newer metric/year] from source

STRICT RULES:
1. Be EXTREMELY specific - include exact data points (numbers, percentages, names)
2. Only suggest items where source documents contain the data - do NOT suggest items if data is missing
3. Focus on quantified, factual data where available
4. Maximum 5 suggestions - focus on the most critical gaps only
5. If the section is complete, state "No critical gaps identified"
6. Do NOT include page numbers, footnotes, or source citations in your suggestions

INSTRUCTIONS:
0. RESPECT SECTION BOUNDARIES: Only add content relevant to "{section['title']}".
   Do NOT add content belonging in other sections:
   {get_section_boundaries(section['number'])}
1. Add ALL items from the ADD list ONLY if the source documents contain supporting data
2. If an ADD item cannot be supported by source document data, skip it silently - do NOT add placeholder text like "metrics not disclosed" or "data unavailable"
3. Use exact data from source documents with numbers and specifics
4. Maintain narrative flow - integrate additions smoothly
5. Preserve all existing content - do not remove anything UNLESS the ADD list provides more recent or more relevant data that should replace outdated information
6. Keep the same format: bullets with bold keywords using **word** syntax
7. If an ADD item duplicates existing content, enhance rather than duplicate

INTEGRATION STRATEGY FOR DENSITY:
• When adding new facts, fuse them with existing content where possible
• Create multi-fact sentences rather than adding new bullets
• Example: Instead of adding separate bullet "Revenue grew 12%" to existing "Malaysia 35%, Indonesia 28%",
  combine: "Malaysia generates 35% of revenue and Indonesia 28%, with combined growth of 12% YoY"

FORMATTING RULES:
- Keep bullet format with **bold** keywords (1-2 most important words per bullet)
- Each bullet is one sentence maximum
- ALWAYS put a blank line before starting any list
- Use consistent markdown formatting

CRITICAL:
- Do NOT add unhelpful statements about missing data
- Do NOT include page numbers, footnotes, or source citations
- Only add content that provides real investor value with specific facts/numbers
- Output ONLY the enhanced section content (## Section Name + bullets). No preamble, no postamble."""

SOURCE DOCUMENTS (for additional quantified details):

TASK:
The content is complete but can be denser. Increase information density without adding new topics by:

1. **FUSION**: Combine related facts from multiple bullets into single multi-fact sentences
   - Example: Two bullets "Malaysia 35% revenue" + "Indonesia 28%" → "Malaysia generates 35% of revenue and Indonesia 28%"

2. **QUANTIFICATION**: Replace qualitative statements with quantified facts from source documents
   - Example: "Strong growth" → "Revenue grew 12% YoY to USD81m"

3. **COMPRESSION**: Remove verbose phrasing while preserving all facts
   - Example: "The company has a presence in" → "Operates in"

4. **ENRICHMENT**: Add specific numbers, percentages, or dates where currently missing
   - Only if data exists in source documents
   - Example: "Several countries" → "9 countries across Asia"

CONSTRAINTS:
• Maintain all existing facts - do not drop information
• Keep section boundaries - stay focused on "{section['title']}"
• Preserve bullet format with **bold** keywords
• Each bullet must remain a complete grammatical sentence
• Skip enrichment if source documents lack supporting data

CURRENT WORD COUNT: {word_count} words
FINAL TARGET: **Aim for {word_limit} words** (exceeding by up to 20 words is acceptable if needed for deeply insightful coverage).

CONDENSING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **PRESERVE STRUCTURE** - The original requirements above define what this section should contain. Preserve coverage of those elements while condensing. Re-ordering to create a coherent flow is allowed.

2. **RELEVANCE FILTER** - Keep only content that meets BOTH criteria:
   - Addresses the original requirements for this section
   - Critical to investment/acquisition decision-making (targeted to the chairman of the potential buyer)

3. **DATA DENSITY**:
   - Preserve specific numbers, percentages, and trends
   - Keep year-over-year comparisons and growth rates and margins and percent contributions
   - Maintain factual density while cutting descriptive text
   - When multiple metrics exist for same item, ALWAYS prefer the most recent fiscal period

4. **SMART CONDENSING**:
   - Remove generic statements and obvious observations
   - Cut repetitive points - state each insight once
   - Eliminate elaborate explanations - let the data speak
   - Focus on what's surprising, notable, or value-affecting
   - Deliver deep insights
   - Combine related facts in one multi-fact sentence to the extent possible and sensible. Example: "Malaysia generates 35% of revenue and Indonesia 28%, with combined growth of 12% YoY" (3 facts, 1 sentence)
   - Be brutal yet constructive when condensing
   
5. **FORMAT PRESERVATION**:
   - Keep bullet format with **bold** keywords (1-2 words per bullet)
   - Each bullet is one sentence
   - Prioritize bullets with numbers and specific facts

WHAT TO PRESERVE:
- Content that addresses the original requirements
- Specific metrics and quantified trends
- Key comparisons and benchmarks
- Unusual patterns or red flags
- Strategic disconnects or opportunities

WHAT TO REMOVE:
- Generic framework language unless specifically relevant
- Repetitive points
- Obvious statements without data
- Elaborate explanations of simple facts
- Content that doesn't address the original section requirements
- Page numbers, footnotes, or source citations

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum {word_limit} words total (count everything)
- Maintain bullet format with **bold** syntax
- Preserve coverage of original requirements
- Every sentence must add investment decision value

- Do NOT include any preamble, introduction, or explanatory text like "Here is the condensed..." or "This section..."
- Do NOT repeat the section name as a header, bold text, or label (the section name is already in the document header)
- Output ONLY the bullet points for this section
- Start directly with the first bullet point (starting with *)
- No commentary about what you are doing - just output the bullets
- No corporate poetry, no consulting buzz words, but chairman-friendly language
- No statements about missing data or need to analyse further, but factual observations
