## SECTION 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Group") is strategically repositioning itself by divesting from its supply chain management services segment to sharpen its focus on its core high-precision manufacturing business. This strategic pivot, coupled with investments in advanced capabilities, forms the bedrock of its competitive advantages over the next 12 months. While the Group reported an overall net loss in FY2024, its core manufacturing segment demonstrated encouraging improvements, indicating early successes in its transformation strategy.

### Three Most Important Competitive Advantages

Over the next 12 months, Fu Yu's economic performance will be materially impacted by the following three competitive advantages:

**1. Advanced, High-Precision Manufacturing Capabilities & Vertical Integration:**
Fu Yu differentiates itself through its long-standing expertise and investments in high-end precision manufacturing. The Group boasts "Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities" in its Singapore Smart Factory, capable of "manufacturing complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2]. This is complemented by a "100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2]. The strategic New Product Introduction ("NPI") team adds value at early stages of the product lifecycle, attracting customers in "higher-margin product categories" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5]. This integrated approach provides a "one-stop solution" for customers, from design to assembly and testing [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2].

*   **Quantitative Impact:** This advantage is directly translating into improved profitability for the core segment. The manufacturing segment's Gross Profit Margin (GPM) expanded by **1.8 percentage points (ppt)** to **13.5% in FY2024** from 11.7% in FY2023 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8]. This indicates potential pricing power and improved operational efficiency relative to general industry players. Furthermore, the Group's order book increased by **20% year-on-year (Y-o-Y) at the end of FY2024**, driven by higher order volumes and new project wins [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6]. The ability to stabilize "5-micron precision level and moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision" further entrenches its technical lead [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6], which is crucial for retaining and attracting high-value projects that typically have higher margins and "sticky" revenue characteristics [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6].

**2. Geographically Diversified Manufacturing Footprint with Singapore HQ:**
In an era of increasing geopolitical tensions and supply chain re-shoring, Fu Yu's distributed manufacturing presence across Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides a significant competitive edge. As a "Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company", it can offer "geographical flexibility" to customers seeking to diversify production away from single regions like China [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6]. This mitigates concentration risk and enhances supply chain resilience for its international client base.

*   **Quantitative Impact:** This diversification is evident in the rebalancing of revenue contributions. While China operations revenue declined by **11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024** due to a slower economy, Singapore operations revenue grew significantly by **20.9% to S$46.2 million**, and Malaysia operations revenue expanded by **24.9% to S$36.6 million** in FY2024 (all compared to FY2023) [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.9]. This strategic shift enabled the manufacturing segment to achieve a **10.5% revenue growth to S$114.9 million in FY2024** from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5], despite the headwinds in China. This ability to pivot and grow in other regions demonstrates superior adaptability compared to less diversified competitors.

**3. Strategic Focus on High-Growth, High-Value Market Segments:**
Fu Yu's deliberate targeting and expansion into high-value sectors such as biomedical, medical, and advanced consumer products positions it favorably against generalist manufacturers. The launch of "Fu Yu Biomedical" in 2023, specifically focusing on "high-precision devices, life sciences products, and consumables" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2], underscores this strategic emphasis. These segments typically offer higher margins and longer project lifecycles due to the complexity and regulatory requirements involved.

*   **Quantitative Impact:** The success in these targeted segments contributed directly to the growth in core manufacturing revenue. Specifically, the **20.9% revenue increase in Singapore operations** and **24.9% increase in Malaysia operations** in FY2024 were "mainly due to higher sales in the medical and consumer segments/products" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.9]. The Group has secured "new projects across a broad spectrum of industries, including medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances" and onboarded "global leaders in wound care and personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5]. These are indicative of its ability to attract and retain high-value customers, underpinning the projected **20% Y-o-Y order book increase** by end of FY2024, promising long-term sustainable revenue [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6].

### Critical Stance and Nuances

While Fu Yu's manufacturing segment demonstrates clear competitive advantages and improved operational performance, it is crucial to maintain a critical stance regarding the overall financial health and potential risks.

Despite the positive developments in the manufacturing segment, the *Group as a whole remained loss-making*, reporting a **net loss of S$3.9 million in FY2024** [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8]. This indicates that the turnaround is still in its early stages and overall profitability remains a significant challenge that may impact investor confidence and access to capital relative to profitable peers.

A notable red flag is the ongoing investigation into its discontinued Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) subsidiary. This investigation led to a **S$3.286 million impairment of goodwill** in FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, p.108] and, critically, resulted in a **qualified opinion from the external auditors** who stated they were "unable to determine the potential financial impact" of the ongoing claims related to FYSCS [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.103]. While management asserts this is "isolated solely to FYSCS" and "do not impact our continuing operations" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6], such an event introduces significant uncertainty and reputational risk, potentially diverting management's focus and affecting market perception and access to financing, thereby indirectly impacting its competitive positioning as a publicly traded entity. The disassociation of the supply chain business from core manufacturing is a positive strategic move, but the circumstances surrounding it introduce immediate financial and governance concerns.

The optimistic claims of "growth trajectory" and "long-term sustainable revenue" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6] from the Chairman's message should be viewed in light of the thin profitability of the continuing operations (Profit before tax of S$0.15 million in FY2024) [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8] and the overall group net loss. The ability to translate these advantages into consistent, substantial net profitability for the entire Group remains a key challenge for the next 12 months.
