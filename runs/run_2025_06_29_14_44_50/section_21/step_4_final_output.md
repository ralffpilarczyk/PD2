## SECTION 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Company"), Singapore's oldest and one of Asia's largest manufacturers of high-end precision plastic and metal components, strategically pivoted in FY2024 to focus solely on its core manufacturing business, ceasing all supply chain management services. Established in 1978, with over 45 years of operating knowledge (AR 24, p.3), this strategic move aims to streamline operations and concentrate resources on its historically profitable, technologically advanced core segment. Fu Yu's expertise lies in serving demanding industries such as medical technology, automotive, and consumer electronics, where precision, reliability, and adherence to stringent quality standards are paramount. While the continuing manufacturing segment demonstrated significant internal improvements, the Group as a whole remained in a net loss of S\$3.9 million in FY2024, albeit narrowed from S\$10.1 million in FY2023, primarily due to the impact of discontinued operations.

Critically, the ongoing investigation into the discontinued Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") has resulted in a qualified audit opinion for FY2024 (AR 24, p.104). This qualification signals material weaknesses in internal controls, raising concerns about financial statement reliability and eroding broader investor trust. This suggests a systemic breakdown in oversight, potentially affecting future operational funding or strategic investments. While management asserts this does not impact continuing operations (AR 24, p.6), this is an overly simplistic claim. The investigation implies deeper systemic governance issues and significant financial liabilities beyond the S\$1.67 million arbitration ruling (AR 24, p.171) and a US\$2.98 million pre-paid commission claim (AR 24, p.100). These indeterminate non-operational risks directly impact investor perception, increase the cost of capital, and constrain financial flexibility, potentially undermining core operational gains and diverting crucial management attention. The Group's healthy net cash position of S\$55.5 million (AR 24, p.8) provides a necessary buffer but becomes less comforting when faced with potentially escalating and undefined liabilities that could consume a significant portion of this liquidity.

### Comparative Financial Performance (Manufacturing Segment)

Key performance indicators for Fu Yu's continuing manufacturing operations demonstrate significant internal improvements.

| Metric (S\$ million, unless stated) | FY2023 (Restated)* | FY2024 (Restated)* | Year-on-Year Change | Source |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ | :----- |
| Revenue                             | 103.9              | 114.9              | +10.6%              | AR 24  |
| Gross Profit                        | 12.1               | 15.5               | +28.1%              | AR 24  |
| Gross Margin (%)                    | 11.7%              | 13.5%              | +1.8 pts            | AR 24  |
| Operating Profit                    | (7.3)              | 0.4                | NM                  | AR 24  |
| Operating Margin (%)                | -7.0%              | 0.4%               | +7.4 pts            | Calc.  |

Revenue grew by 10.6%, with Gross Profit surging by 28.1% and Gross Margin expanding by 1.8 percentage points, suggesting effective cost management and a favorable product mix shift. Operating Profit saw a remarkable turnaround from a S\$7.3 million loss to a S\$0.4 million profit, with Operating Margin improving by 7.4 percentage points. This dramatic swing reflects successful cost-cutting and efficiency gains within the manufacturing units. These figures underscore management's success in optimizing the core business's operational efficiency and profitability, validating the strategic pivot and demonstrating the underlying strength of Fu Yu's manufacturing capabilities.

### Competitive Positioning in Precision Manufacturing

Fu Yu's competitive edge in the high-end precision manufacturing space stems from several key differentiators. Its long-standing reputation and extensive experience foster deep trust with blue-chip clients requiring exacting standards and reliable supply, a vital competitive advantage for client stickiness. Its advanced manufacturing capabilities, exemplified by its flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, capable of complex mould inserts, 3D metal printing, and a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products (AR 24, p.3), produce intricate components with tight tolerances for demanding sectors. Operational excellence, including vertically-integrated services (AR 24, p.18) and a skilled workforce with decades of tool-making expertise (AR 24, p.18), provides a competitive advantage in lead times and consistency within its established global supply chain. Fu Yu's niche focus on high-complexity, high-value components, combined with strong client relationships, positions it favorably to capitalize on ongoing trends like miniaturization and increasing demand for advanced materials across its target sectors. This strategic alignment allows Fu Yu to command premium pricing and maintain higher margins. The challenge remains to fully isolate the core business's value from the lingering uncertainties of the FYSCS investigation.
