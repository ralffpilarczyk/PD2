## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

**Overview:**
Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") is a Singapore-headquartered precision plastic and metal components manufacturer with a vertically-integrated business model. The Group's operational footprint is diversified across six strategic manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China, spanning over 1.5 million square feet of production capacity. This distribution supports its strategy of providing a one-stop solution to customers while adapting to global supply chain dynamics. However, recent significant changes, notably the cessation of the supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) under troubling circumstances involving internal control failures and an ongoing investigation, and an increased strategic focus on high-precision manufacturing, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, demand a critical assessment of the Group's actual operational stability and strategic execution. The FYSCS discontinuation, rooted in serious governance issues rather than merely a "strategic discontinuation" as initially implied by management, raises fundamental questions about overall management trustworthiness and internal controls, impacting the interpretation of all subsequent strategic claims.

### a. Geographic Footprint and Main Operating Assets

The Group operates through a network of wholly-owned subsidiaries across three key Asian countries, enabling geographical flexibility and supporting its international customer base.

**Key Operating Sites & Strategic Importance:**
The Group's six manufacturing sites are strategically located across:
*   **Singapore:** Focuses on high-precision tooling and manufacturing, including the advanced Smart Factory with 100K-class cleanroom facilities and over 9,348 sqm of usable space. This site is crucial for high-value, high-precision products in sectors like life sciences, medical, and automotive, aligning with the Group's stated high-value strategic shift.
*   **Malaysia (Johor and Penang):** Supports a broader range of manufacturing activities, offering cost-effectiveness and an alternative production base, aligning with customer demands for supply chain diversification.
*   **China (Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen):** Continues to provide significant manufacturing capacity, though the Group is strategically re-aligning its revenue contribution away from this region. This implies potential underutilization of assets in China given the static total capacity.

**Ownership of Key Assets:**
As of 31 December 2024, the Group's property, plant, and equipment (PPE) had a carrying amount of S$58.603 million, with a significant portion being owned. This indicates direct control over core manufacturing infrastructure. Additionally, some leasehold properties are utilized to support operations, and investment property (leased to third parties) had a carrying amount of S$5.842 million. While the total value of owned assets is provided, specific historical operational data on the square footage or distinct capacity metrics *per site* (e.g., number of machines per facility, specific cleanroom sizes by location), or the breakdown of PPE value by geographical location for the last three years, is not disclosed in the provided documents. This absence significantly hampers the ability to assess if capital allocation genuinely aligns with the stated strategic shift towards high-precision manufacturing in Singapore and Malaysia, or if significant underutilized capacity exists in regions like China.

*Note: Historical data for employee distribution by category (management levels) and interim period data is not disclosed in the provided documents.*

The overall headcount has significantly decreased across all regions, including the strategically important Singapore and Malaysia. Given the stated strategic shift towards higher-value manufacturing in these regions, this universal decline in headcount, beyond the impact of the FYSCS closure (131 temporary staff), warrants deeper scrutiny. It raises questions about whether this reflects successful automation and efficiency improvements (positive) or a broader contraction in overall manufacturing volume (negative), or challenges in talent attraction/retention. Without data on revenue or output per employee trends, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, it is difficult to discern if the reduction signifies enhanced productivity or a shrinking operational scale.

### c. Key Operational Data Points and Scale

**Production Capacity & Scale:**

| Data Point                         | FY2024 Value    | Unit            | FY2023 Value* | FY2022 Value* | Date/Period | Source                                       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Total Production Floor Capacity    | >1.5            | million sq ft   | >1.5          | >1.5          | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"     |
| Singapore Smart Factory Usable Space | >9,348          | sqm             | -             | -             | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"  |
| Singapore Smart Factory Cleanroom Class | 100K            | class           | 100K          | 100K          | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, p.5                   |
| Total Solar Energy Generation Capacity | Up to 3,233     | MWh             | -             | -             | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"  |
| Product Precision Level            | 5               | micron          | 5             | 5             | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"  |
*Note: Unless specifically stated, historical values for these operational metrics beyond FY2024 were not explicitly detailed in the provided documents, though some general capacity/precision levels are likely consistent across years.*
*Source notes from original analysis confirmed general consistency where data was not specific for earlier years.*

The constancy of the total production floor capacity at >1.5 million sq ft over three years, coupled with the explicit strategic shift of revenue away from China, strongly suggests uneven utilization rates across regions. This implies potential underutilization of assets in China, which could be a drag on returns, while Singapore/Malaysia may be operating at or nearing capacity limits. The lack of historical data for key investments like Singapore Smart Factory usable space and solar energy generation capacity makes it challenging to track the pace and scale of these strategic initiatives and verify their impact over time.

**Customer Data:**

| Data Point                                | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Q4 FY2024 | Q3 FY2024 | Q2 FY2024 | Q1 FY2024 | Unit      | Source                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Customers contributing >10% of Group Revenue | 3      | 1      | 1      | N/A       | N/A       | N/A       | N/A       | # customers | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.138, "Concentration of revenue" |
*Note: Interim period data for customer concentration is not disclosed in the provided documents.*

Crucially, the three customers contributing >10% of Group revenue in FY2024 were *all* from the discontinued supply chain management services segment. This reveals that the Group's *core manufacturing business* has a highly diversified customer base, effectively mitigating customer concentration risk – a significant operational strength that contradicts a superficial reading of the headline figure.

### d. Significant Changes and Trends in Operating Footprint

**1. Discontinuation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):**
The Group ceased all business activities in its supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) in the last quarter of FY2024. While management commentary attributed this cessation to an "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business," financial disclosures and the auditor's qualified opinion paint a starkly different and more concerning picture. An internal audit in July 2024 highlighted "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management, including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," and "irregular expense claims." An ongoing investigation with external legal and accounting firms (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd) is in progress, with claims intended against "certain persons" related to misuse of resources and prepaid commissions. This indicates a profound governance and internal control failure, rather than merely a leadership gap or strategic pivot, posing material financial and reputational risks. Such a critical internal control breakdown raises fundamental questions about management's transparency and the reliability of broader operational oversight.

Ltd."; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.26, "Discontinued Operations".

**2. Geographical Revenue Re-alignment (Manufacturing Segment):**
The Group is actively shifting its manufacturing revenue away from China, demonstrating execution on its strategy to offer geographical flexibility amidst geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain shifts.

| Revenue Contribution (Manufacturing) | FY2024 (%) | FY2023 (%) | Change (ppt) | Trend   | Date/Period       | Source                                   |
|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Singapore                            | 40.2%      | 36.8%      | +3.4         | Increase | FY2024 vs FY2023  | Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance" |
| Malaysia                             | 31.9%      | 28.2%      | +3.7         | Increase | FY2024 vs FY2023  | Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance" |
| China                                | 27.9%      | 35.0%      | -7.1         | Decrease | FY2024 vs FY2023  | Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance" |
*Note: The provided financial statements (Q424) offer this geographical revenue breakdown annually for the manufacturing segment, but do not provide these percentages for individual interim periods (Q1, Q2, Q3) within FY2024.*

This shift is a positive confirmation of strategic execution, enhancing supply chain resilience and reducing reliance on a single region. However, the profitability implications of this shift (e.g., higher or lower margins in Singapore/Malaysia compared to China) are not disclosed, which would be crucial for assessing its overall financial impact.

**3. Employee Headcount & Turnover Trends:**
Overall employee numbers have decreased over the last three years. While new hire rates were very high in FY2022 and FY2023 (likely reflecting high churn or expansion), they significantly reduced in FY2024. Concurrently, turnover rates, while still notable, have also decreased in FY2024, which could indicate a period of stabilization after prior volatility. Management aims to maintain turnover (excluding temporary workers) below 30% going forward.
<sup>4</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.49, "Employment"; p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate".

| Employee Movement | FY2024   | FY2023   | FY2022   | Unit | Date/Period | Source                                         |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| New Hires         | 366      | 903      | 883      | #    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.49, "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate" |
| New Hire Rate     | 26.7%    | 60.7%    | 57.4%    | %    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.49, "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate" |
| Turnover          | 342      | 949      | 918      | #    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate" |
| Turnover Rate     | 24.9%    | 63.8%    | 59.7%    | %    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate" |
*Note: Interim period data for new hires and turnover is not disclosed in the provided documents.*

The significant drop in both new hires and turnover in FY2024 suggests a stabilization of the workforce and potentially improved retention. However, the persistent overall headcount reduction, despite strategic focus on certain regions, warrants deeper scrutiny. It is unclear if this reflects successful automation driving higher output per employee, or if it is primarily attributable to the FYSCS segment discontinuation or a broader contraction in overall business activity.

**4. Investments in Technology and Sustainability:**
The Group continues to invest in its Smart Factory (e.g., ERP system, automation tools for overnight production, 3D printing for rapid prototyping, which reduced toolroom downtime by 40%) and renewable energy (solar panels across Singapore, Johor, and Penang facilities, with up to 3,233 MWh generation capacity). These efforts aim to enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and lower carbon emissions.
<sup>5</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.31, "Increasing energy prices", p.47, "Renewable Energy".

While these are positive strategic investments aligned with Industry 4.0 and ESG demands, the analysis lacks specific CapEx figures for these investments and quantifiable financial impact beyond the 40% toolroom downtime reduction (e.g., specific energy cost savings, impact on overall operational expenditure or gross margins). This makes it challenging to assess the true return on investment and scale of impact from these initiatives.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The Group's operating footprint is strategically designed to enhance its competitive positioning through several key aspects. However, the realization of these advantages is critically tied to addressing the internal control weaknesses and demonstrating clearer operational efficiencies.

1.  **Vertical Integration and One-Stop Solution:** By offering product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing, Fu Yu provides comprehensive, one-stop manufacturing services. This integration increases value-add for customers, fosters long-term partnerships, and differentiates it from less integrated competitors, promoting stronger customer retention.
    <sup>6</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.18, "Our Business".
2.  **Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities:** The Singapore Smart Factory, with its high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and 100K-class cleanroom, positions Fu Yu at the forefront of advanced manufacturing. This enables the Group to target high-margin sectors like life sciences, medical, and automotive, supporting its strategic shift towards higher-value products. The ability to stabilize 5-micron precision products further enhances this capability.
    <sup>7</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE".
3.  **Geographical Flexibility & Supply Chain Resilience:** Operating in Singapore, Malaysia, and China allows the Group to offer geographical diversification in a volatile geopolitical environment. This flexibility is critical as customers seek to de-risk their supply chains away from a single country of origin, particularly China. The demonstrated strategic shift of revenue contribution towards Singapore and Malaysia reflects this adaptation and enhances resilience.
    <sup>8</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance".
4.  **Operational Efficiency and Sustainability:** Investments in Industry 4.0 machinery, automation (reducing toolroom downtime by 40%), and an integrated cloud-based ERP platform aim to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance quality. The adoption of solar energy and focus on eco-friendly materials (e.g., biodegradable bio-resin) caters to growing customer demand for sustainable products and contributes to a "greener, more responsible footprint," which can also improve access to capital.
    <sup>9</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.32, "Shift in customer preferences"; p.35, "Innovation in sustainable technologies", p.37, "Renewable energy integration"; p.47, "Our Initiatives".
5.  **Focus on New Product Introduction (NPI):** The NPI team's role in the early stages of the business cycle helps secure new projects in higher-margin categories, building customer confidence and ensuring long-term revenue streams. The increased order book (+20% YoY) is an early indicator of success from this strategy.
    <sup>10</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE".

While these competitive advantages are conceptually sound and support Fu Yu's strategic direction, their full realization is contingent on the Group effectively addressing the severe internal control weaknesses exposed by the FYSCS investigation. Furthermore, the absence of granular, historical per-site operational data (1.a, 1.c) and comprehensive quantitative impact metrics for strategic investments (1.d.4) limits the ability to fully verify the efficiency gains, asset utilization, and quantified differentiation from competitors beyond management's qualitative statements. The overall headcount reduction across all regions (1.b), despite strategic growth areas, also requires clearer reconciliation with productivity gains to fully assess the operating structure's efficiency.
