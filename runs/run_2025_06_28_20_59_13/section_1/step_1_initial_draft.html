    </table>

    <p>The Group's total workforce decreased from 1,535 in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024, a reduction of approximately 10.6% over two years. This reduction is notable, especially considering the cessation of the supply chain management services segment in Q4 FY2024, which previously made up 39.9% of the Group's total revenue in FY2024. The data shows a shift in employee distribution, with a significant portion of temporary employees (131) now located in China, suggesting a more flexible workforce strategy in that region. The near 1:1 male-to-female ratio across the entire workforce (50.0% male, 50.0% female) highlights the Group's commitment to gender equality in employment.</p>

    <p>Employee turnover rates for FY2024 were 24.9% overall (342 employees), with 11.5% for male new hires and 15.2% for female new hires. The Group aims to maintain a turnover rate (exclusive of temporary workers) below 30% moving forward. The decline in non-hazardous waste due to improved production efficiency also implies a more skilled and efficient workforce in manufacturing operations, potentially contributing to the reduction in total employee numbers while maintaining or improving output.</p>

    <h3>c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu's geographical footprint, spanning Singapore, Malaysia, and China, is a cornerstone of its business strategy, particularly in a global environment characterized by supply chain disruptions and geopolitical shifts. The distribution of manufacturing sites across these three countries allows the Group to offer "geographical flexibility" to its customers, a critical advantage as more clients seek to diversify production away from China. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singapore: High-Value & Advanced Manufacturing Hub</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Singapore Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1) serves as the Group's hub for advanced precision engineering. Its capabilities in complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and a 100K-class cleanroom are essential for high-margin sectors like biomedical and life sciences. The launch of Fu Yu Biomedical in 2023, operating from the same Singapore HQ, reinforces this strategic pivot towards high-precision medical technology and biotechnology. This focus on high-value, high-precision manufacturing aligns with Singapore's role as a technological and innovation center. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, "COMPANY PROFILE" section; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small></li>
                <li>Singapore operations revenue contribution to total manufacturing sales increased to 40.2% in FY2024 from 36.8% in FY2023, indicating successful execution of this strategy. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section)</small></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Malaysia: Growing Regional Manufacturing Base</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Malaysia's operations (Penang and Johor) are expanding their contribution, showing a 24.9% increase in revenue to S$36.6 million in FY2024 from S$29.3 million in FY2023, primarily driven by higher demand for medical and consumer products. This growth signifies Malaysia's importance as a robust and expanding manufacturing base complementing Singapore's high-end focus. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section)</small></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>China: Diversified Local Market Focus</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite a decline in revenue contribution (down 11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024), China's facilities remain critical for serving the local "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" markets. This strategy mitigates risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade shifts, ensuring continued presence and market access in a large economy. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section; Fuyu Pres H124, Page 14, "Conclusion & Outlook", "Industry Outlook")</small></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The diversified geographic footprint directly supports Fu Yu's competitive positioning as a "trusted manufacturing partner for innovative, high-performance products" by providing resilience against regional disruptions and offering flexible production solutions to international customers seeking to de-risk their supply chains.</p>

    <h3>d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu has undergone several significant changes and embraced key trends in its operating footprint, primarily driven by strategic transformation and external market factors.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> The Group ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") in the last quarter of FY2024. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 11, "E Selected notes to the condensed interim financial statements", Note 1 "Corporate Information")</small></li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This strategic decision allows Fu Yu to reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business, sharpening its focus on high-precision manufacturing. FYSCS contributed 39.9% of the Group's total revenue in FY2024, and its cessation represents a substantial streamlining of the operating model. The company initiated investigations into FYSCS's affairs, which highlighted significant weaknesses in its risk management process. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Page 8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW" section)</small></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Geographic Revenue Shift:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Revenue contribution by location has evolved. Singapore and Malaysia operations gained significant share, while China's contribution decreased.

    <h3>e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning</h3>

    <p>Fu Yu's operating structure is intricately designed to support and enhance its competitive positioning as a leading manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Vertically-Integrated Manufacturing Services:</strong> The Group's ability to offer a "one-stop solution" (product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing) creates significant value-add for customers. This end-to-end capability streamlines the manufacturing process, reduces lead times, and ensures quality control across all stages, fostering long-term partnerships with a diverse and loyal customer base. The introduction of the New Product Introduction ("NPI") team further strengthens this by adding value in the early stages of the business cycle, particularly for higher-margin product categories. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, "COMPANY PROFILE" section; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Advanced Technology and High-Precision Capabilities:</strong> The flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, equipped with Industry 4.0 machinery, 3D metal printing, and a 100K-class cleanroom, positions Fu Yu at the forefront of precision manufacturing in Asia. Its capability to produce complex mould inserts and achieve 5-micron precision (with a target for even higher levels) allows the Group to secure new projects in demanding sectors like medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances, where precision and quality are paramount. This technological edge supports its reputation for innovative, high-performance products. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, "COMPANY PROFILE" section; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Geographical Flexibility:</strong> Operating across Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides a critical competitive advantage, especially in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty. As more customers seek to diversify their supply chains away from China, Fu Yu's multi-country production footprint offers the agility and resilience needed to mitigate risks and cater to evolving sourcing preferences. This allows them to maintain a diversified customer base and adapt to global supply chain shifts. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Operational Efficiency and Sustainability:</strong> Investments in automation (reducing downtime by 40%), energy-efficient electric machines (replacing hydraulic ones), and solar panel installations across facilities demonstrate a commitment to operational excellence and sustainability. These initiatives not only reduce operating costs but also align with growing customer and stakeholder demand for eco-friendly practices, enhancing the Group's brand and long-term viability. The ERP system also promises improved accuracy, efficiency, and real-time collaboration, contributing to overall plant performance. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section; Page 32, "Transitional Risk" section, "Disruption caused by sustainable technologies"; Page 36, "Innovation in sustainable technologies"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives", "Innovative Production", "Renewable Energy")</small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Strategic Focus:</strong> The decision to cease the supply chain management services segment and reallocate resources solely to the core manufacturing business signifies a sharper strategic focus. This allows the Group to concentrate its expertise and capital on its most competitive and high-growth areas, enhancing overall business performance and order book, which increased by 20% year-on-year at the end of FY2024. <small>(Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE" section)</small>
