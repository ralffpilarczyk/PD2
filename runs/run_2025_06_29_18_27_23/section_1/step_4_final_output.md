## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

Maxis operates primarily within Malaysia, aiming for integrated telecommunications leadership. While its footprint supports extensive coverage and customer experience, resource allocation and long-term sustainability warrant critical review.

### a. Employee Distribution and Development

Maxis' human capital trends raise long-term capacity questions. Total headcount reduced 19.4% from 4,078 (2022) to 3,288 (2024) [AR 2024, p.42], contributing to staff cost reduction from RM880 million (2023) to RM839 million (2024) [AR 2024, p.135, Note 7]. Average training hours per employee fell 24% (from 32.06 in 2022 to 24.38 in 2024) [AR 2024, p.42]. This cost-optimization, without clear productivity metrics, poses substantial long-term non-financial risks, raising concerns about skill gaps, employee morale, burnout, and future service degradation. Granular employee distribution by function or precise location remains undisclosed, limiting detailed operational assessment post-rationalization.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Strategic Importance, and Significant Changes

Maxis' operating assets reflect its integrated telco model, with a mix of owned (Property, Plant & Equipment: RM5,091M in 2024) and leased (Right-of-Use Assets: RM1,794M in 2024) infrastructure crucial for connectivity [AR 2024, p.141, Note 15; p.144, Note 17]. Network coverage remains extensive: 4G at 96%, 5G at 82.4% (2023-2024), and fibre footprint exceeds 23,000 km [AR 2024, p.3, p.28].

A critical change is the **sustained reduction in Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)**. CAPEX decreased 17% from RM813 million (2023) to RM675 million (2024) [AR 2024, p.3], continuing into 1Q25 with a remarkably low RM86 million [25Q1 FS, p.16]. This trend in a capital-intensive industry, alongside growing blended data usage (33.2 GB/month in 1Q25), risks future network capacity, service quality, and competitive standing, particularly with the impending dual 5G network model (post-DNB agreement). This implies a significant risk of lagging infrastructure, hindering Maxis' ambition to be "The Leading Integrated Telco."

### c. Geographic Footprint, Operating Structure, and Unit Economics

Maxis' nationwide Malaysian footprint aligns with its "Leading Integrated Telco" vision, leveraging DNB equity for future 5G [AR 2024, p.11, p.149, Note 21]. The operating structure supports competitive positioning (extensive network, CX focus) and unit economics through efficiency. Cost efficiency initiatives, like energy management (4,372 MWh savings) and 4G to 5G traffic offloading (>20%), optimize network efficiency and unit cost per GB [AR 2024, p.3, p.28, p.36]. Workforce reduction directly impacts staff costs, improving EBITDA margins. However, the sustainability of these cost reductions hinges on avoiding long-term operational impairment, such as reduced service quality or employee morale issues, which are non-financial risks needing critical assessment. Data reliability concerns exist, noted by "limited visibility of source data" and "methodology change" for water consumption [AR 2024, p.40], posing a red flag for environmental reporting consistency.

**Table 1: Key Operational Metrics & Trends**

| Metric                      | 2022  | 2023  | 2024  | 1Q25 | Source                                |
| :-------------------------- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- | :------------------------------------ |
| Total Employees             | 4,078 | 3,803 | 3,288 | N/A  | [AR 2024, p.42]                       |
| Avg. Training Hrs/Employee  | 32.06 | 25.99 | 24.38 | N/A  | [AR 2024, p.42]                       |
| CAPEX (RM million)          | 674   | 813   | 675   | 86   | [AR 2024, p.3]; [25Q1 FS, p.16]       |
| Blended Data Usage (GB/month) | 29.5  | 31.3  | 31.3  | 33.2 | [25Q1 Pres, p.21]                     |

**Overall Insight:** Maxis' operating footprint reflects a strategic pivot towards a more efficient, digitally-driven model. While management emphasizes "sustainable growth" and "operational excellence" with supporting data on cost savings and network performance, the notable and sustained reduction in CAPEX and employee training hours, coupled with significant workforce rationalization, warrants close attention. These trends, if not balanced with sufficient investment in future capabilities and human capital development, could pose long-term non-financial risks to competitive positioning, innovation capacity, and customer satisfaction, potentially impacting future unit economics. Furthermore, identified data gaps and transparency concerns in areas like employee distribution and environmental metrics limit the depth of external evaluation, raising questions about the completeness of the operational picture presented to stakeholders.
