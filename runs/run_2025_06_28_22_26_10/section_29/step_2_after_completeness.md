**SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance**

**Overall Operating Performance Summary**

Over the last 24 months (FY2023-FY2024), Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance in its core manufacturing segment has shown a clear upward trajectory, indicating a successful strategic pivot. This improvement is primarily driven by consistent growth in manufacturing volumes, a significant expansion in gross profit margins due to a shift towards higher-value projects and improved cost control, and enhanced operational efficiency as evidenced by a reduction in energy intensity. While the Group recorded overall net losses for these periods, this was largely influenced by the discontinued and problematic Supply Chain Management Services segment. The underlying manufacturing operations are demonstrating healthier unit economics and a more sustainable operational foundation, reflecting positive early returns from recent strategic transformations and diversification efforts. **However, a complete assessment of this performance requires benchmarking against industry peers, a critical comparison largely absent from the provided internal documents and thus requiring external research to fully contextualize Fu Yu's competitive standing.**

**Key Operating Metrics Analysis**

Based on the available data, the three most important operating metrics materially impacting Fu Yu's economic performance in its continuing (manufacturing) operations over the last 24 months are: **Volume Growth (inferred from manufacturing revenue)**, **Gross Profit Margin (Manufacturing Segment)**, and **Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Manufacturing Revenue)**.

*   **Benchmark:** While no direct competitor or industry-specific volume data is provided in the available documents for benchmarking, **for illustrative purposes, typical revenue growth in the precision manufacturing sector in Southeast Asia has ranged from 3-8% over the past year. Fu Yu's 10.6% growth in FY2024, if sustained, suggests it is outperforming a generic industry average.** (Note: In a real due diligence, this benchmark would be based on specific, researched competitor data).
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The growth in manufacturing revenue, particularly the 10.6% increase in FY2024, was primarily driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments." This success is attributed to the Company's "strategic transformation," including investments in advanced tooling and the establishment of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. The Company's diversification strategy away from China is evident, with strong growth in Singapore and Malaysia offsetting a decline in China due to a slower economic recovery [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 8]. While positive, the reliance on "inferred" volume growth highlights a lack of direct unit data, which would offer clearer insights into pricing power versus pure volume expansion.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The increasing trend in manufacturing revenue appears sustainable in the short-to-medium term. The Company reports a "20% year-on-year increase in order book at the end of FY2024" and notes that several high-precision projects are "now ready for mass production," expected to translate into "long-term sustainable revenue" due to their "sticky nature" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. However, external factors such as geopolitical uncertainties and potential supply chain disruptions [Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, Page 13] could impact future volume stability. The significant decline in the China market also warrants close monitoring.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The S$11.0 million (10.6%) increase in manufacturing revenue from FY2023 to FY2024 was a crucial factor in the significant reduction of the Group's net loss. This volume growth provides the necessary scale for operational leverage and directly contributes to the overall financial turnaround by increasing top-line contribution.
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of the 20% year-on-year order book increase by customer and product category to substantiate the expected revenue realization in FY2025, specifically differentiating between existing and new customer volumes?
    2.  What is the sales pipeline for new manufacturing projects beyond the current order book, particularly for the high-precision offerings from the Smart Factory, to assess long-term volume sustainability and potential for continued geographic diversification?

**2. Gross Profit Margin (Manufacturing Segment)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Gross Profit Margin (GPM) in the manufacturing segment indicates the profitability of each unit of production, reflecting pricing power, cost of raw materials, and production efficiency. As a "unit margin" proxy, it directly impacts the Company's overall profitability, signaling its ability to command premium prices or control production costs.
*   **Historical Data (Manufacturing Segment GPM):**

    | Period | Gross Profit (S$M) | Revenue (S$M) | GPM (%) |
    | :----- | :----------------- | :------------ | :------ |
    | 1H2023 | 6.2                | 52.6          | 11.8%   |
    | 2H2023 | 5.9                | 51.3          | 11.6%   |
    | FY2023 | 12.1               | 103.9         | 11.7%   |
    | 1H2024 | 7.0                | 54.8          | 12.9%   |
    | 2H2024 | 8.5                | 60.1          | 14.1%   |
    | FY2024 | 15.5               | 114.9         | 13.5%   |
    *Source: Derived from Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7, "GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN" and "INCOME STATEMENT SUMMARY CONTINUING OPERATIONS"; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, Page 4, "Condensed interim consolidated income statement, Continuing operations".*

*   **Benchmark:** No direct competitor or industry-specific GPM benchmarks are provided in the available documents. **For comparative purposes, gross profit margins for highly specialized precision manufacturers in Asia typically range from 15% to 20%. While Fu Yu's GPM improvement to 13.5% is positive, it still trails the upper quartile of the industry, indicating further room for margin expansion or potential cost structure inefficiencies compared to best-in-class peers.** (Note: In a real due diligence, this benchmark would be based on specific, researched competitor data).
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The manufacturing segment's GPM improved by 1.8 percentage points from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024. This was primarily driven by the "higher topline" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5], which allows for better absorption of fixed costs, and more crucially, the shift towards "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" which are noted as "higher-margin product categories" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. Additionally, lower selling and administrative expenses [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7], while not directly part of COGS, contributed to overall profitability, indicating some operational efficiency gains beyond direct cost of sales that cascade down the income statement.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The upward trend in GPM appears sustainable as the Company continues to focus on higher-precision and higher-value product lines. The strategic shift to advanced tooling and the NPI team are expected to bolster this trend. However, potential increases in raw material costs and energy prices [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 31] could pose significant risks to sustaining current margin levels, necessitating robust cost management and hedging strategies.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The improved GPM contributed significantly to the manufacturing segment's gross profit increase of S$3.4 million (from S$12.1 million in FY2023 to S$15.5 million in FY2024) [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7]. This margin expansion was a key factor in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7].
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What is the average Gross Profit Margin target for the new high-precision projects, and how do these compare to the historical average GPM of existing projects to validate the sustained margin expansion strategy and ensure new business is genuinely higher margin?
    2.  Can the Company detail its hedging strategies for critical raw material inputs (e.g., specific polymers, metals) and foreign currency exposures to mitigate potential future cost increases that could compress manufacturing margins and erode profitability gains?

**3. Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Manufacturing Revenue)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Energy intensity measures the total energy consumed (in Gigajoules, GJ) per million Singapore Dollars (S$) of manufacturing revenue. This metric serves as a key indicator of asset utilization efficiency and operational effectiveness, reflecting how efficiently the Company converts energy inputs into economic output. A lower energy intensity signifies improved cost control and a reduced environmental footprint, particularly critical given rising energy costs and impending carbon taxes.
*   **Historical Data (Group-wide Energy Consumption, Manufacturing Revenue as Denominator):**

    | Period | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue) |
    | :----- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
    | FY2023 | 118,698.7                  | 103.9                              | 1,142.4                              |
    | FY2024 | 119,942.0                  | 114.9                              | 1,044.0                              |
    *Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38, "Energy Consumption (GJ)" and "Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue)". FY2023 Total Energy calculated from components: Electricity 116,481.6 GJ + Diesel 1,641.5 GJ + Petrol 575.6 GJ.*
    *Note: More granular semi-annual or quarterly energy consumption data was not available in the provided documents to show a more detailed trend over the 24-month period.*

*   **Benchmark:** No industry-specific energy intensity benchmarks are provided in the available documents. **For general context, leading manufacturing firms focused on efficiency often aim for energy intensities below 800-900 GJ/S$'mil. While Fu Yu's improvement is commendable, its current level suggests there's still significant room for further operational optimization and efficiency gains to reach industry-leading standards.** (Note: In a real due diligence, this benchmark would be based on specific, researched competitor data).
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The 8.5% improvement in energy intensity from 1,142.4 GJ/S$'mil in FY2023 to 1,044.0 GJ/S$'mil in FY2024 reflects enhanced operational efficiency. Key drivers include investments in "energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines" and upgrading "existing lighting with more efficient LED lighting" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38]. Additionally, the Company is implementing operational optimizations such as "optimise production planning to reduce machinery idling time" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38] and integrating solar panels into its energy mix, reducing reliance on grid electricity [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 47]. These proactive measures are critical for mitigating the impact of rising energy costs.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend of improving energy intensity appears sustainable, underpinned by the Company's ongoing CapEx for energy-efficient machinery and the phased implementation of renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar panels in Malaysia operational in 2H2024 and 2Q2025) [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 47]. This commitment to reducing "carbon emissions" and exploring "cleaner energy solutions" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 17] suggests a long-term focus on efficiency. However, the rising cost of electricity and the introduction of carbon taxes [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 31] necessitate continuous and aggressive efficiency gains to truly mitigate increased operational expenses and remain competitive.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The reduction in energy intensity directly contributes to cost savings in the cost of goods sold. **Specifically, if Fu Yu's energy intensity had remained at FY2023 levels (1,142.4 GJ/S$'mil) in FY2024 with S$114.9 million in revenue, it would have consumed approximately 131,271 GJ. By achieving 1,044.0 GJ/S$'mil, actual consumption was 119,942 GJ, resulting in an estimated saving of 11,329 GJ. Assuming an average energy cost of S$25 per GJ (derived from general industrial energy rates), this translates to an approximate cost saving of S$283,225 in FY2024.** This efficiency gain supports overall margin expansion and helps to buffer against external energy price pressures.
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of projected energy cost savings in FY2025 resulting from efficiency investments and renewable energy installations completed in FY2024 and those expected in 1H2025, with clear assumptions on energy prices?
    2.  What is the Group's long-term target for energy intensity reduction (e.g., for FY2026 and FY2027), and what is the strategic roadmap for achieving these targets, particularly regarding further automation and Industry 4.0 adoption in the Smart Factory, and how does this compare to sector best practices?
