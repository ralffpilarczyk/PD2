## SECTION 5: Key Competitors

### Analysis of Maxis's Competitive Landscape

Maxis Berhad operates in a dynamic and highly competitive telecommunications sector in Malaysia, characterized by evolving regulatory landscapes and shifting consumer demands. The company positions itself as "Malaysia's leading integrated telco," aiming to provide converged services across mobile, home, and enterprise segments. However, the competitive environment presents both significant opportunities and inherent risks.

#### a. List of Key Competitors and Their Recent Strategic Moves

Maxis's official documents do not explicitly list direct competitors by name with their specific strategic moves, which is a common limitation in management reporting that tends to focus on internal achievements. However, key competitors can be inferred from the discussions on market structure, regulatory changes, and competitive dynamics.

**Inferred Key Competitors:**

1.  **CelcomDigi (formerly Celcom Axiata and Digi.Com Bhd):** The merger between Celcom and Digi, completed in late 2022, created the largest mobile network operator in Malaysia by subscriber base. This is implied by Maxis's mention of "increased competition arising from mergers between market players" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 23, "Competition Risk"].
    *   **Recent Strategic Moves (Inferred):** The primary strategic move is the merger itself, aiming for scale, network integration, and cost synergies. This new entity poses a significant competitive threat across all segments.
2.  **Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB):** A government-owned entity established to deploy Malaysia's 5G wholesale network. Maxis has an existing access agreement with DNB.
    *   **Recent Strategic Moves:** DNB's core strategy is to build and operate a single wholesale 5G network. The significant recent development is the government's transition from a single wholesale network model to a dual network model, and the selection of a second mobile network operator (U Mobile) to build and operate Malaysia's second 5G network [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Government Initiatives and Regulations"; Maxis 24Q4 FS, p. 25, "Interests in Digital Nasional Berhad"].
3.  **U Mobile Sdn. Bhd.:** A mobile network operator in Malaysia.
    *   **Recent Strategic Moves:** U Mobile was "selected as the mobile network operator to build and operate the nation's second 5G network" on 1 November 2024 [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Government Initiatives and Regulations"; Maxis 24Q4 FS, p. 25, "Interests in Digital Nasional Berhad"]. This move significantly alters the 5G competitive landscape, as U Mobile will now be a direct infrastructure competitor in 5G, potentially impacting wholesale agreements and market dynamics.
4.  **Telekom Malaysia (TM):** As a major fixed broadband provider (Unifi), TM is a key competitor in the home and enterprise fixed connectivity segments. While not explicitly named as a "competitor," Maxis's focus on "Home" and "Enterprise" fibre expansion directly competes with TM's offerings.
    *   **Recent Strategic Moves (Inferred):** Continued expansion of fibre infrastructure and bundled offerings to retain and attract customers in the fixed broadband market. Maxis's documents do not provide specific details on TM's recent initiatives, reflecting a common limitation in single-company reporting.
5.  **Smaller Competitors:** Maxis acknowledges "irrational moves by smaller competitors in product/services offerings" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 23, "Competition Risk"], suggesting aggressive pricing or promotions that could disrupt market stability.

#### b. Market Structure and Competitive Dynamics

The Malaysian telecommunications market is undergoing significant structural changes, particularly concerning 5G deployment, which is reshaping competitive dynamics.

*   **Shift to Dual 5G Network Model (Most Recent: Ministerial Direction on 31 December 2024):** The government's decision to transition from a single wholesale 5G network (DNB) to a dual network model introduces new complexities and opportunities. Maxis, having an existing agreement with DNB, now faces the strategic decision of how to "leverage two 5G networks" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Government Initiatives and Regulations"; Maxis 24Q4 FS, p. 25, "Interests in Digital Nasional Berhad"]. This shift implies increased competition in 5G infrastructure and services in the medium term. Maxis states it is "exploring all avenues to enhance our 5G offerings" and will "consider the available options after discussions with all stakeholders" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 7, "Chief Executive Officer's Statement"; Maxis 24Q4 TS, p. 19, "FY2025 financial outlook"].
*   **Intensified Competition:** Maxis acknowledges "increasing competitive pressures within the telecommunications industry" and specifically mentions "increased competition arising from mergers between market players" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Industry Trends"; p. 23, "Competition Risk"]. This directly refers to the Celcom-Digi merger, which created a larger, more formidable rival.
*   **Evolving Consumer Expectations:** Customers demand "faster, more reliable connectivity and user-friendly digital platforms" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 5, "Chairman's Statement"]. Maxis responds by prioritizing customer experience, digital self-service, and AI integration.
*   **AI-Driven Digital Transformation:** The "strategic push for AI-driven digital transformation" and the launch of the National AI Office (NAIO) indicate a national agenda that telcos must align with [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Government Initiatives and Regulations"]. This creates opportunities for telcos like Maxis to offer AI-driven solutions for businesses and consumers.
*   **Data Governance and Cybersecurity:** Increased focus on these areas by the government translates to "increased compliance requirements" and a need for telcos to "enhance cybersecurity capabilities" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Government Initiatives and Regulations"; p. 17, "Cybersecurity"]. This can be a competitive differentiator for trusted providers.

#### c. Product Comparisons and Areas of Competition

Maxis competes across three core business segments: Mobile, Home, and Enterprise. While direct side-by-side comparisons of Maxis's products against competitors' specific features or pricing are not available in Maxis's public documents, the detailed description of Maxis's offerings implicitly highlights its competitive stance.

*   **Mobile:**
    *   **Postpaid vs. Prepaid:** Maxis employs a "dual-brand strategy" (Maxis for premium, Hotlink for value-driven) [Maxis 24 AR, p. 30, "Product and Service Innovations in 2024"]. They aim to encourage "prepaid customers to transition to postpaid plans, which provide a more stable revenue stream" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 8, "Financial Review"].
        *   **Maxis Postpaid:** Enhanced plans offer "unlimited 5G data for MP109 and above," and MP79 includes "300GB of data" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 30, "Product and Service Innovations in 2024"].
        *   **Hotlink Postpaid:** Offers "50GB + 50GB 5G for RM45, 100GB + 100GB 5G for RM60 and 150GB + 150GB 5G for RM70" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 30, "Product and Service Innovations in 2024"].
        *   **Hotlink Prepaid:** Enhanced with "RM40 Unlimited 5G Data and RM25 for 30GB + 30GB 5G" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 30, "Product and Service Innovations in 2024"].
    *   **5G Services:** Maxis leverages its agreement with DNB for 5G services and is actively engaging stakeholders to shape its long-term 5G strategy amidst the dual network transition [Maxis 24 AR, p. 7, "Chief Executive Officer's Statement"]. They conducted "Malaysia's first 5G-Advanced technology trial" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 28, "Technological Milestones"].
    *   **Network Quality:** Maxis emphasizes its "industry-leading LTE network" and "96% 4G population coverage" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 23, "Competition Risk"; p. 28, "Network Performance & Coverage"]. They also highlight "all-time highs for TP-NPS: +70" and "maintained speeds exceeding 3Mbps for 95% of the time" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 28, "Customer Experience & Service Quality"].
*   **Home:**
    *   **Fibre Connectivity:** Maxis aims to transform homes with "cutting-edge high-speed fibre plans and routers" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 11, "Our Strategy"]. They provide access to "7.8 million premises" and have a ">23,000 km fibre footprint" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 3, "Operational Highlights"].
    *   **Fixed Wireless Access (FWA):** All FWA plans shifted to 5G with flexible contract options [Maxis 24 AR, p. 31, "Key Achievements"].
    *   **Value-Added Services:** Maxis Home Solar launch, Max WiFi restructuring, same-day installation services for own-built fibre customers [Maxis 24 AR, p. 31, "Key Achievements"; Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 2, "Maintaining Steady Progress in Q1 2025"].
*   **Enterprise:**
    *   **Connectivity & Digital Solutions:** Maxis offers a "robust portfolio of enterprise products and ICT solutions" including IoT, cloud, and AI, with security at the core [Maxis 24 AR, p. 11, "Our Strategy"; p. 32, "Enterprise"].
    *   **Specific Offerings:** GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS), DC Connect (linking major data centres), SD-WAN, Maxis IoT Connect platform, Telco API solutions for cybersecurity and fraud prevention [Maxis 24 AR, pp. 32-34, "Enterprise"].
    *   **SME Focus:** Key enabler of SME digitalisation through initiatives like Geran Digital PMKS Madani and UsahaWIRA [Maxis 24 AR, p. 34, "Enterprise"].

(Implied values for interim periods are derived from QoQ/YoY changes and cumulative figures where direct quarterly figures are not explicitly stated for all metrics in the provided documents).

**Market Share Trends & Implications:**
*   **Mobile Subscriber Growth:** Maxis's total consumer subscriptions increased by **3.7% YoY to 10.56 million as of 1Q25** [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 19, "RGS30 and ARPU"]. This growth is primarily driven by postpaid subscribers, which grew **9.1% YoY to 3.98 million in 1Q25**. Prepaid subscribers, however, show a slight decline of **0.5% QoQ in 1Q25** and a marginal increase of **0.3% YoY in 1Q25** [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 19, "RGS30 and ARPU"]. This aligns with management's strategy to encourage migration to postpaid plans for a more stable revenue stream [Maxis 24 AR, p. 8, "Financial Review"].
*   **5G Adoption:** 5G device subscriptions grew by **50% to 3.7 million users in FY2024**, with 5G penetration increasing from 27% (2023) to 38% (2024) [Maxis 24 AR, p. 27, "Key Achievements"]. This rapid adoption suggests successful 5G propositions.
*   **Home Connectivity:** Home connections grew by **4.5% YoY to 784,000 in FY2024** [Maxis 24 AR, p. 8, "Financial Review"] and further increased to **787,000 by 1Q25** [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 19, "RGS30 and ARPU"]. This indicates successful expansion in the fixed broadband market.
*   **Claim of "Market Share Growth at Twice Industry Rate":** Maxis states it "successfully grew our market share at twice the industry rate" in its mobile segment [Maxis 24 AR, p. 30, "Product and Service Innovations in 2024"]. However, the provided documents do not offer industry-wide market share data or growth rates to independently verify this claim. This is an optimistic assertion that lacks transparent supporting data within the report, making it difficult for an external analyst to validate.
*   **ARPU Trends:**
    *   **Consumer Postpaid ARPU:** Decreased from RM75.1 in 1Q24 to RM71.8 in 1Q25 (down 4.4% YoY) [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 19, "RGS30 and ARPU"]. Management attributes this to "reduced interconnect rates & seasonality" and "changes in Maxis Device Care offering" [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 5, "Consumer Mobile"; Maxis 25Q1 TS, p. 2, "Consumer Mobile"]. This indicates pricing pressure or a shift towards lower-tier postpaid plans.
    *   **Consumer Prepaid ARPU:** Decreased from RM37.2 in 1Q24 to RM34.3 in 1Q25 (down 7.8% YoY) [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 19, "RGS30 and ARPU"]. This decline could be due to intense competition in the value segment or changing usage patterns.
    *   **Home Blended ARPU:** Remained relatively stable, showing a slight decrease from RM110.4 in 1Q24 to RM110.1 in 1Q25 (down 0.3% YoY) [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 19, "RGS30 and ARPU"]. This suggests successful value retention in the home segment.

**Competitive Strategies:**
Maxis's competitive strategies revolve around:
1.  **Customer Experience as a Differentiator:** Achieved a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +70 in 2024 [Maxis 24 AR, p. 3, "Operational Highlights"]. This is a key stated competitive advantage, aiming to maintain leadership in converged solutions [Maxis 24 AR, p. 23, "Competition Risk"].
2.  **Converged Solutions:** Leveraging its LTE network and fibre connectivity to offer integrated mobile, home, and enterprise solutions [Maxis 24 AR, p. 23, "Competition Risk"]. The 2025 strategy explicitly prioritizes "bundling and cross-selling to construct consumer fortress" and "deepen convergence strategy" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 12, "Our Strategy"; p. 30, "Outlook"].
3.  **Digitalization and AI Adoption:** Enhancing digital self-service, integrating AI into contact centers, and deploying proprietary AI platforms like "Dexter" to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction [Maxis 24 AR, p. 7, "Chief Executive Officer's Statement"].
4.  **Operational Excellence and Cost Discipline:** Focus on "streamlining operations and maintain strict cost discipline" to drive efficiencies and improve profitability [Maxis 24 AR, p. 15, "Our Strategic Response"]. This is reflected in the positive EBITDA growth despite competitive pressures.
5.  **Strategic Partnerships:** Collaborations with Sarawak Digital Economy Corporation, major tech companies (Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Dell Technologies), network equipment vendors (Nokia, China Mobile International), and telco peers (Singtel, Bridge Alliance) to enhance capabilities and expand service offerings [Maxis 24 AR, p. 5, "Chairman's Statement"; p. 34, "Industry Collaborations & Ecosystem Growth"]. The "Maxis 5G Alliance" expanded to 75 members by end of FY2024 [Maxis 24 AR, p. 34, "Industry Collaborations & Ecosystem Growth"].

#### e. Current Positioning and Recent Changes

Maxis's current positioning is that of "Malaysia's leading integrated telecommunications provider" [Maxis 24 AR, p. 26, "Mobile"]. This positioning is supported by its strong subscriber base, extensive network coverage (96% 4G population coverage, >11,000 network sites in FY2024) [Maxis 24 AR, p. 3, "Operational Highlights"], and a comprehensive suite of converged services.

**Recent Changes and Their Impact:**
*   **Dual 5G Network Model (Post-FY2024 development):** The government's decision, announced in November 2024, to implement a dual 5G network model, with U Mobile selected for the second network, is a critical shift. Maxis is currently in discussions with stakeholders to determine its long-term 5G strategy [Maxis 24Q4 TS, p. 19, "FY2025 financial outlook"]. This introduces a new layer of competitive complexity and uncertainty regarding 5G infrastructure and service provision. While Maxis has an existing DNB agreement, the future competitive landscape for 5G could involve more direct competition on infrastructure and potentially wholesale pricing.
*   **Maxis Device Care Program Changes (Q1 2025):** A new commercial arrangement for the SafeDevice program has impacted service revenue recognition, leading to a 0.9% YoY decline in service revenue in 1Q25, though with a "slight improvement to EBITDA" [Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 17, "Analysis of Performance"]. This suggests a strategic shift in how device-related services are bundled and recognized, possibly to optimize profitability or customer value.
*   **Continued Focus on Customer Experience:** The high NPS of +70 in 2024 indicates strong customer satisfaction, which is crucial for retention in a competitive market [Maxis 24 AR, p. 3, "Operational Highlights"].
*   **Strategic Priorities for 2025:** Maxis has outlined five key priorities for 2025:
    1.  Bundle and cross-sell to construct consumer fortress.
    2.  Grow enterprise business, without straying far from core.
    3.  Building infrastructure and wholesale.
    4.  Digitalise and adopt AI.
    5.  Operating with excellence.
    These priorities reflect a proactive stance to maintain market leadership and drive sustainable growth amidst evolving market dynamics [Maxis 24 AR, p. 12, "Our Strategy"; Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 20, "Prospects for the Financial Year Ending 31 December 2025"].

**Critical Stance on Management's Commentary:**
While Maxis presents a positive outlook and strong internal performance metrics (e.g., subscriber growth, EBITDA, NPS), the absence of direct comparative market share data against key competitors like CelcomDigi or Telekom Malaysia makes it challenging to fully assess its "leading" position or the impact of "irrational moves by smaller competitors." The narrative consistently highlights Maxis's strengths and strategic responses, but the actual competitive intensity and its potential impact on market share are not quantified with external benchmarks. The ongoing "discussions with all stakeholders" regarding the dual 5G network model signal that the 5G competitive strategy is still fluid and subject to significant future developments, which could introduce further risks or opportunities not fully articulated in the current outlook.
