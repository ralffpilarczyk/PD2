## Section 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

### Financial Summary

The Group's consolidated revenue was S$191.3 million in FY2024 [AR p.8], a slight increase from S$190.4 million in FY2023 but a notable decline from S$240.1 million in FY2022 [AR p.28]. This largely reflects the cessation of the supply chain segment [FS Q424 p.15]. Consolidated EBITDA improved to S$6.33 million in FY2024 from S$(1.31) million in FY2023. Net loss significantly narrowed from S$(10.11) million to S$(3.89) million [AR p.114]. Operating cash flow turned positive at S$3.6 million in FY2024 [AR p.6]. GAAP financials are presented; EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. One-time items include significant impairments. Industry comparisons were not provided.

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**Key Achievements:**
1.  **Narrowed Net Loss:** The Group significantly reduced its consolidated net loss from S$(10.11) million in FY2023 to S$(3.89) million in FY2024 [AR p.114], primarily driven by improved manufacturing segment performance and effective cost management [FS Q424 p.31].
2.  **Positive Operating Cash Flow:** FY2024 saw a strong rebound in net operating cash flow, turning positive at S$3.60 million from a S$4.54 million outflow in FY2023, signaling improved operational efficiency and working capital management [AR p.6, AR p.116].

**Key Challenges:**
1.  **Stagnant Overall Revenue:** Despite growth in the manufacturing segment, total consolidated revenue remained largely flat (0.5% increase) in FY2024 compared to FY2023, primarily due to the declining and subsequently ceased supply chain management services segment [AR p.8, FS Q424 p.15].
2.  **Persistent Net Loss:** The Group continues to report a consolidated net loss, influenced by losses from discontinued operations, including a S$3.29 million goodwill impairment charge related to this segment in FY2024 [AR p.114, AR p.112].

**Areas of Disconnect between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
1.  **EBITDA Calculation Consistency:** Management's explicitly reported `EBITDA from Continuing Operations` (S$8.5 million for FY2024, S$0.6 million for FY2023) [AR p.8] does not reconcile with a standard calculation of Operating Income plus Depreciation from the consolidated statements, suggesting potential non-GAAP adjustments or segment-specific exclusions not fully transparently reconciled in the general notes [AR p.114, p.116].
2.  **Unusual Cash Conversion Metric:** The specified "Cash conversion" metric (EBITDA / (EBITDA/Capex)) yielded highly volatile and sometimes counter-intuitive results (e.g., very high for FY2023 despite negative EBITDA), indicating it may not effectively represent the Group's cash flow generation efficiency or capital intensity in a consistent manner compared to more standard metrics [Calculated: Table in Section 7].
