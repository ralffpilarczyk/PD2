    </li>
</ul>

<h3>c. Disconnects Between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies</h3>

A significant disconnect exists in the context of the cessation of the Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS) segment and its implications for internal controls and resource allocation.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Strategic Objective (1):</strong> To sharpen focus on the core manufacturing business and reallocate resources accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Strategy (2):</strong> Optimizing operational footprint and supply chain by ceasing FYSCS activities and reallocating resources.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disconnect:</strong> While the <em>decision</em> to cease FYSCS operations and reallocate resources aligns with strategic objectives, the preceding issues within FYSCS indicate a substantial breakdown in internal controls and risk management, which impacted the Group's financial position and reputation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Details of Disconnect:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internal Control Weaknesses (Historical):</strong> The internal audit report dated 26 July 2024 (received 7 August 2024) highlighted "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management process. This led to an overall assessment rating of "Cause for considerable concern" for FYSCS [1, p.99, "Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls"; 2, p.11, "1. Corporate Information"; 2, p.11, "2. Basis of Preparation"].</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing Investigation:</strong> An ongoing investigation (commissioned 8 October 2024) into FYSCS's affairs, with an interim report dated 5 February 2025, identified "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," "questionable conduct" by a seconded general manager, and "irregular expense claims." The auditor issued a qualified opinion on the financial statements due to inability to determine the potential financial impact of these ongoing matters [1, p.104, "Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements"; 1, p.100, "Directors' Statement"; 1, p.171, "Note 32: Ongoing investigation..."].</li>
            <li><strong>Impact on Resource Allocation & Focus:</strong> Although FYSCS activities ceased in Q4 FY2024, the ongoing investigation and potential claims against individuals [1, p.100, "Directors' Statement"; 1, p.172, "Note 32: Ongoing investigation..."] represent a drain on management time, legal resources, and potentially financial resources. These could divert attention and capital from the stated objective of "sharpening its focus on its core manufacturing business" and achieving "long-term sustainable revenue" in the manufacturing segment. The Board states that internal controls for the Supply Chain Management Segment <em>may be inadequate</em> as of 31 December 2024 [1, p.99, "Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls"].</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This disconnect highlights a challenge in executing the strategic pivot, where past operational and governance failures in a divested segment could impede the full realization of benefits from re-focusing on the core business.</p>
