**b. Key Recent Trends**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Total Group Revenue:** Stagnated in FY2024 (0.5% growth to S$191.3M) after a significant decline in FY2023 (down 20.7% from S$240.1M in FY2022). This stagnation is attributed to the decline in the discontinued supply chain management services segment in 2H24, which offset the growth in the manufacturing business.
    *   **Continuing Operations (Manufacturing) Revenue:** Demonstrated healthy growth, increasing by 10.5% to S$114.9M in FY2024 from S$103.9M in FY2023. This growth was particularly strong in 2H24 (up 17.2% to S$60.1M vs 2H23 S$51.3M) and supported by new projects and higher order volumes.
*   **Margin Evolution:**
    *   **EBITDA Margin (Continuing Operations):** Showed substantial improvement in FY2024, reaching 7.4% from a very low 0.6% in FY2023, indicating enhanced operational efficiency. However, the interim trend is concerning: margins declined significantly in 2H24 (3.0%) compared to 1H24 (4.6%), and even more sharply compared to 1H23 (12.0%) and 2H23 (10.7%). This points to margin pressure in the latter half of 2024 for the core manufacturing business.
    *   **Operating Margin (Continuing Operations):** Turned positive in FY2024 at 0.4%, a strong recovery from a negative (7.1%) in FY2023. Similar to EBITDA, 2H24 saw operating margin at 1.4%, an improvement over 1H24's (0.7%), but still reflecting challenges.
    *   **Net Margin (Continuing Operations):** Remained negative in FY2024 at (1.1%) but significantly improved from (7.3%) in FY2023. Interim periods show persistent net losses, with 2H24 at (0.9%) and 1H24 at (1.3%).
*   **Cash Flow Generation:**
    *   **Net Cash from Operating Activities:** Reversed from a significant outflow of S$(4.5)M in FY2023 to a positive inflow of S$3.6M in FY2024. This positive shift is a critical improvement, suggesting better working capital management and reduced losses.
    *   **Interim Cash Flow:** 1H24 demonstrated robust positive operating cash flow (S$3.6M), while 2H24 turned slightly negative (S$(0.1)M). This suggests that the strong cash generation observed for the full year predominantly occurred in the first half.
    *   **Cash Conversion (OCF/EBITDA):** Improved dramatically from a highly negative (756.2%) in FY2023 to 42.4% in FY2024, though it remains below 100%. The variability across interim periods (142.8% in 1H24 vs. (3.1%) in 2H24) indicates fluctuations in cash management or operational efficiency on a half-yearly basis.

**c. Margin Analysis**

The improvement in profitability metrics (EBITDA, Operating Income, Net Income) for continuing operations in FY2024 is commendable, especially considering the challenging operating environment. Gross profit margin for the manufacturing segment increased to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023 [AR, p.8], indicating better pricing, cost control, or product mix in the core business. This was achieved due to "lower expenses relating to employee costs, travelling expenses, water and electricity charges and sundry expenses" [AR, p.29]. However, the declining trend in EBITDA and Operating margins within the manufacturing segment from 1H23 to 2H24 suggests increasing pressure on the core business's profitability. This could be due to higher input costs, increased competition, or a less favorable product mix in the latter half of the year, even as revenue was growing.

**d. Cash Flow Assessment**

The return to positive net operating cash flow in FY2024 (S$3.6M) from a significant outflow in FY2023 (S$(4.5)M) is a major positive. This was mainly driven by "lower loss before tax for FY2024 and a decrease in inventories and trade and other receivables, offset by a reduction in trade and other payables" [AR, p.8]. The company significantly ramped up capital expenditure in FY2024 (S$6.9M vs S$4.0M in FY2023), reflecting investments in "factory equipment, plant and machineries" [AR, p.9], which is a healthy sign for future growth if managed effectively. Despite this, cash and cash equivalents remained stable at around S$55.5M, a healthy balance sheet position driven by a strong net cash balance.

### 2. Performance Assessment

*   **Achievement vs. Guidance:**
    *   **FY2024 Performance:** Management reported FY2024 revenue growth of 0.5% (total) and 10.5% (continuing operations) [AR, p.8], along with a significant narrowing of net loss from S$(10.1)M to S$(4.5)M. This aligns with the Chairman's message of "FY2024 net loss from our continuing operations has narrowed sharply to S$1.2 million from S$7.6 million" and "EBITDA increased more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million from S$0.6 million" [AR, p.6].
    *   **Guidance:** For FY2025, the Group "remains optimistic that financial performance... will improve compared to FY2024, barring unforeseen circumstances" [Q424 Interim, p.29]. This is supported by a 20% year-on-year increase in order book at the end of FY2024, with high-precision projects ready for mass production [AR, p.6].
*   **Key Drivers of Performance:**
    *   **Manufacturing Segment Revival:** The core manufacturing business (continuing operations) showed strong revenue growth and improved gross margins, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, driven by new project wins and higher order volumes in medical and consumer segments [AR, p.9].
    *   **Cost Management:** A 20.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses (FY2024 vs FY2023) significantly contributed to the narrowed losses [AR, p.29].
    *   **Strategic Transformation:** Investments in the Smart Factory, new product introduction (NPI) team, and advanced tooling have started to yield results, securing new customers and higher-margin projects [AR, p.6].
*   **Industry Comparison:** The provided documents do not offer specific industry benchmarks for direct comparison. However, the narrative suggests a "challenging operating environment" [AR, p.6] and "slower-than-expected recovery in China's economy" [AR, p.9], implying a difficult external landscape where the Group's improvements stand out.

### 3. Management Discussion & Analysis (MDNA) Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**a. 2 Key Achievements**

1.  **Significant Turnaround in Core Manufacturing Profitability:** The Group achieved a remarkable shift in its continuing (manufacturing) operations, moving from an operating loss of S$(7.4) million in FY2023 to an operating profit of S$0.5 million in FY2024 [AR, p.108]. This was underpinned by a substantial increase in EBITDA from S$0.6 million to S$8.5 million in the same period [AR, p.8]. This turnaround demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategic transformation, increased order volumes in medical and consumer segments, and diligent cost-containment measures [AR, p.6, p.9].
2.  **Successful Cessation of Underperforming Segment and Strengthening of Core Focus:** The Group proactively ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions (FYSCS) in Q4 FY2024 to reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business [AR, p.6]. While this incurred a goodwill impairment of S$3.3 million [AR, p.6] and is subject to ongoing investigation, the strategic decision to exit a non-core, loss-making segment (FYSCS reported a loss of S$2.7M from discontinued operations in FY2024 [Q424 Interim, p.15]) is a positive step towards streamlining operations and sharpening focus on high-precision manufacturing.

**b. 2 Key Challenges**

1.  **Profitability Erosion in 2H2024 for Core Business:** Despite overall annual improvement, the core manufacturing segment experienced a significant decline in profitability in 2H24. EBITDA for the manufacturing segment dropped to S$1.8M in 2H24 from S$2.5M in 1H24 and S$5.5M in 2H23 [Q424 Interim, p.14]. Similarly, EBITDA margin for the manufacturing segment contracted from 12.0% in 1H23 to 3.0% in 2H24. This indicates a concerning trend of margin compression for the continuing operations in the latter half of 2024, possibly due to pricing pressures, shifting product mix, or rising operational costs not fully offset by efficiency gains.
2.  **Operational Disruptions and Financial Fallout from Discontinued Operations:** The cessation of FYSCS, while strategically sound, unveiled significant underlying issues, including an internal audit report highlighting "significant weaknesses" and an ongoing investigation into "purported misuse of FYSCS's resources" and "irregular" expense claims, leading to a qualified audit opinion for FY2024 [AR, p.100, p.104]. Furthermore, the subsequent S$1.67 million claim in favor of Evertree Hongkong Limited [AR, p.171] represents a tangible financial consequence of these issues. These events suggest past governance and operational failures in the discontinued segment, which incurred S$2.7 million in losses from discontinued operations in FY2024 [Q424 Interim, p.15].

**c. 2 Areas of Disconnect between Management Statements and Actual Performance**

1.  **Discrepancy in EBITDA Reporting:** Management's "Financial Highlights" section in the Annual Report states "EBITDA from Continuing Operations increased more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million from S$0.6 million" for FY2024 and FY2023 respectively [AR, p.8]. However, the "Reportable Segments" table in the Q424 Interim Financial Statements, which provides "Segment profit/ (loss) before tax*" (defined as excluding depreciation, impairment of goodwill, loss on liquidation of subsidiary, finance cost, interest income and foreign exchange gain/(loss)), shows significantly different figures for the Manufacturing Segment (which is the continuing operation): S$4.37 million for FY2024 and S$11.77 million for FY2023 [Q424 Interim, p.14]. This inconsistency in defining and reporting a key non-GAAP metric like EBITDA creates confusion and questions the transparency of financial communication.
2.  **Downplaying the Severity of FYSCS Issues:** While the Chairman's Message mentions the S$3.3 million one-off non-cash impairment of goodwill related to FYSCS and states the Board is "investigating the past affairs" [AR, p.6], it explicitly reiterates that "these investigations are isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations" [AR, p.6]. However, the independent auditor has issued a *qualified opinion* specifically due to the "ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd," stating they "were unable to determine the potential financial impact, if any" [AR, p.104]. This qualified opinion, along with the subsequent arbitration ruling for S$1.67 million, indicates a more significant, unresolved risk and financial impact than management's commentary suggests, potentially downplaying the severity and uncertainty associated with these past affairs.
