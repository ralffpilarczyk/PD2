## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

### 1. Executive Summary

**Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("the Group") presents a complex financial picture, characterized by a resilient core Manufacturing segment offset by the significant, negative impact of the discontinued Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS) segment.** This analysis reviews key financial metrics for the last three fiscal years and four most recent interim periods, drawing primarily from the company's financial disclosures.

While the Manufacturing segment achieved pre-tax profitability in FY2024 and contributed to improved consolidated cash flow from operations, the Group remained in a net loss position. Critically, **the consolidated financial statements for FY2024 received an auditor's qualified opinion** due to ongoing investigations into financial irregularities within FYSCS. This situation creates **substantial, unquantified risks** for future performance and shareholder value, despite the underlying operational improvements in the core business. *(Note: Data for FY2022 interim periods and certain annual metrics were not comprehensively provided, limiting some trend analyses. Industry comparison data was also unavailable in source materials.)*

#### c. Key Recent Trends

1.  **Revenue Shift & Growth:** Overall Group revenue saw only a marginal **0.5%** increase in FY2024, despite strong growth in the Manufacturing segment (up **10.5%** in FY2024). FYSCS was discontinued in Q4 FY2024, leading to a significant **45.8%** drop in overall Group revenue in 2H2024. While the core manufacturing business demonstrated consistent quarterly growth (S$52.6M in 1H23 to S$60.1M in 2H24), the Group's top-line remains largely stagnant and faces a significant revenue hole from FYSCS's exit, requiring accelerated manufacturing growth.
2.  **Profitability Turnaround (Manufacturing) - Nuance Needed:** The Manufacturing segment (continuing operations) shifted from a substantial loss before tax of S$**8.1 million** in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S$**0.15 million** in FY2024. This was due to higher revenue and a **20.4%** reduction in selling and administrative expenses. EBITDA from continuing operations dramatically increased from S$**0.6M** in FY2023 to S$**8.5M** in FY2024. However, Net Income (Cont. Ops) remained negative (S$**1.2M** loss in FY2024), indicating persistent burdens from corporate overheads, unallocated finance costs, or tax, thus the "turnaround" is incomplete at the net profit level.
3.  **Consolidated Loss & Discontinuation Impact:** Despite manufacturing's recovery at the PBT level, the consolidated Group recorded a net loss of S$**3.9 million** in FY2024, though sharply narrowed from S$**10.1 million** in FY2023. This loss is primarily attributable to the loss from discontinued operations (FYSCS), which accounted for S$**2.7 million** in FY2024.
4.  **Improving Margins (Post-FYSCS):** The Group's gross profit margin improved from **7.0%** in FY2023 to **8.9%** in FY2024. The Manufacturing segment's gross margin specifically improved from **11.7%** to **13.5%**. This trend is expected to continue as the problematic FYSCS business is removed, benefiting consolidated results. EBITDA margin for continuing operations also saw a significant jump.

#### d. Cash Flow Assessment

1.  **Operating Cash Flow Improvement:** The Group transitioned from a net operating cash outflow of S$**4.5 million** in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S$**3.6 million** in FY2024. This shift indicates better working capital management and reduced operational losses.
2.  **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Capex increased from S$**4.0 million** in FY2023 to S$**6.9 million** in FY2024, representing a higher percentage of total revenue (from **2.1%** to **3.6%**). This reflects strategic investments in manufacturing assets, particularly for the Smart Factory in Singapore.
3.  **Cash Conversion Fluctuations & Concerns:** Cash conversion recovered to **37.4%** for FY2024, indicating improved efficiency. However, the 2H24 period saw a slight operating cash outflow, resulting in negative cash conversion for that specific half (**-1.0%**). This late-year reversal is a significant red flag, suggesting unstable cash generation capabilities, potentially due to new working capital dynamics or one-off transition costs. This volatility impacts sustainable internal funding for future Capex.
4.  **Strong Net Cash Position:** Despite losses and investments, the Group maintained a healthy net cash position of S$**55.5 million** as at 31 December 2024. This provides crucial financial flexibility for operations, strategic initiatives, and potential legal costs related to the FYSCS investigation.

#### e. Industry Context (Qualitative)

*(As noted previously, specific competitor or industry benchmark data was not available in the provided documents.)* The precision manufacturing sector is highly competitive, demanding high quality, efficiency, and continuous technological investment. Fu Yu's manufacturing segment gross margin of **13.5%** in FY2024 and a significant improvement in EBITDA margin for continuing operations to **7.4%** suggest a positive trend in operational efficiency. While direct industry comparisons are unavailable, these trends indicate a solid internal return to core business profitability. Increased capital expenditure further aligns with the industry's need for ongoing investment in advanced machinery to maintain competitiveness and pursue higher-value projects.

### 3. MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

#### a. 2 Key Achievements

1.  **Successful Turnaround of Core Manufacturing Business (FY2024):** The Group's strategic transformation efforts clearly paid off in its core manufacturing segment. Revenue grew by **10.5%** in FY2024 to S$**114.9 million**, driven by new projects and higher order volumes. More impressively, the manufacturing segment reversed a significant loss before tax of S$**8.1 million** in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S$**0.15 million** in FY2024. This achievement validates their focus on high-precision manufacturing.
2.  **Significant Improvement in Operational Efficiency and Cash Flow Generation:** Selling and administrative expenses for continuing operations decreased by a substantial **20.4%** in FY2024, contributing to improved profitability. Concurrently, the Group successfully converted a net operating cash outflow of S$**4.5 million** in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S$**3.6 million** in FY2024. This indicates enhanced working capital management and cost containment.

1.  **Discontinuation and Financial Impact of Supply Chain Segment (FYSCS):** The Group ceased all FYSCS activities in Q4 FY2024 due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate." This led to a significant loss from discontinued operations of S$**2.7 million** in FY2024, impacting overall consolidated profitability. This reflects not just talent issues but a strategic misstep into a non-core business that became a substantial financial drain.
2.  **Ongoing Investigation and Audit Qualification Related to FYSCS:** This is the most critical challenge. The external auditor issued a **"Qualified Opinion"** on the FY2024 financial statements specifically due to an "ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd." The investigation highlights serious concerns including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," and "irregular expense claims." This points to serious corporate governance failures and potential financial misconduct, posing a significant and unquantified financial and reputational risk, impacting financial statement reliability.

#### c. 2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance/Data

1.  **Management's Portrayal vs. Auditor's Qualification on FYSCS:**
    *   **Management Statement:** The Chairman's message positively frames the cessation of FYSCS as a strategic move, stating "these investigations are isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations." The interim report also cited "inability to identify a suitable candidate."
    *   **Actual Performance/Data Disconnect:** This constitutes a significant **selective narrative framing and an attempt at reputational damage control**. The auditor's qualified opinion directly contradicts the "isolated" narrative, stating they "were unable to determine the potential financial impact... in respect of the Claims which pertain to FYSCS." The detailed allegations ("unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," "irregular expense claims") strongly suggest **fraud or severe mismanagement**, far more serious than a simple talent issue. The S$**3.3M** goodwill impairment in FY2024 for FYSCS directly preceded its cessation, suggesting underlying issues were already present.
    *   **So What:** Management's downplaying of the severity creates a major overhang of unquantified financial risk (e.g., potential legal costs, fines, write-offs of unrecoverable amounts) and fundamentally challenges the reliability of the financial statements and overall corporate governance, eroding investor trust.
2.  **Revenue Growth Narrative vs. Consolidated Topline Stagnation:**
    *   **Management Statement:** The Chairman highlights "revenue from our continuing operations (manufacturing) grew by **10.5%** to S$**114.9 million** in FY2024." The 1H2024 review stated "Group-wide revenue rose **78.0%**." The FY2025 outlook forecasts a "20% year-on-year" increase in order book.
    *   **Actual Performance/Data Disconnect:** While manufacturing grew, *total consolidated Group revenue* only increased by a marginal **0.5%** for FY2024. The significant **78.0%** growth in 1H2024 was heavily influenced by the volatile FYSCS segment, which then drastically declined in 2H2024.
    *   **So What:** This is a clear case of **selective focus and potentially misleading optimism**. Emphasis on manufacturing growth, while accurate for the segment, obscures the reality that the overall Group top-line is largely stagnant year-on-year and faces a steep decline in 2H2024 due to FYSCS cessation. The forward-looking optimism for FY2025, linked to the manufacturing order book, does not explicitly quantify how the absence of FYSCS revenue or the investigation's financial impact will factor into the overall Group's "improved financial performance." This suggests manufacturing must achieve exceptionally high growth just to offset the revenue gap left by FYSCS, posing a significant challenge to overall Group growth.
