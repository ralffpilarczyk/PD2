## SECTION 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Group") is strategically repositioning itself by divesting from its supply chain management services segment to sharpen its focus on its core high-precision manufacturing business. While the Group reported an overall net loss in FY2024, its core manufacturing segment demonstrated encouraging improvements, indicating early successes in its transformation strategy. This analysis relies solely on Fu Yu's FY2024 Annual Report and therefore **cannot provide direct quantitative comparisons against named competitors or industry averages** for metrics such as market share, specific pricing premiums, or customer retention rates. The competitive advantages discussed below reflect Fu Yu's internal strengths and strategic positioning that underpin its potential for improved financial prospects over the next 12 months.

### Three Most Important Competitive Advantages

Over the next 12 months, Fu Yu's economic performance will be materially impacted by the following three competitive advantages:

**1. Advanced, High-Precision Manufacturing Capabilities & Vertical Integration:**
Fu Yu differentiates itself through long-standing expertise and investments in high-end precision manufacturing. Its "Singapore Smart Factory" boasts "Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities," capable of "manufacturing complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2]. This is complemented by a "100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2]. The strategic New Product Introduction ("NPI") team adds value at early product lifecycle stages, attracting customers in "higher-margin product categories" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5] and providing a "one-stop solution" from design to assembly and testing [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2].

*   **Quantitative Impact:** This advantage is directly translating into improved core segment profitability. The manufacturing segment's Gross Profit Margin (GPM) expanded by **1.8 percentage points (ppt)** to **13.5% in FY22024** from 11.7% in FY2023 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8]. This GPM expansion, coupled with the ability to stabilize "5-micron precision level and moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6], indicates nascent pricing power stemming from its specialized technical lead. The Group's order book increased by **20% year-on-year (Y-o-Y) at the end of FY2024**, driven by higher order volumes and new project wins [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6]. While specific pricing premiums over competitors cannot be quantified from the AR, the ability to attract and retain high-value projects with "sticky" revenue characteristics [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6] suggests a strong value proposition in its niche.

**2. Geographically Diversified Manufacturing Footprint with Singapore HQ:**
In an era of increasing geopolitical tensions and supply chain re-shoring, Fu Yu's distributed manufacturing presence across Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides a significant competitive edge. As a "Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company," it offers "geographical flexibility" to customers seeking to diversify production away from single regions like China [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6]. This mitigates concentration risk and enhances supply chain resilience for its international client base.

*   **Quantitative Impact:** This diversification is evident in the rebalancing of revenue contributions. While China operations revenue declined by **11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024**, Singapore operations revenue grew significantly by **20.9% to S$46.2 million**, and Malaysia operations revenue expanded by **24.9% to S$36.6 million** (all compared to FY2023) [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.9]. This strategic shift enabled the manufacturing segment to achieve a **10.5% revenue growth to S$114.9 million in FY2024** from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5], despite headwinds in China. This ability to pivot and grow in other regions demonstrates strong adaptability and resilience within its operational structure.

**3. Strategic Focus on High-Growth, High-Value Market Segments:**
Fu Yu's deliberate targeting and expansion into high-value sectors such as biomedical, medical, and advanced consumer products positions it favorably. The launch of "Fu Yu Biomedical" in 2023, focusing on "high-precision devices, life sciences products, and consumables" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2], underscores this emphasis. These segments typically offer higher margins and longer project lifecycles due to complexity and regulatory requirements.

*   **Quantitative Impact:** Success in these targeted segments contributed directly to core manufacturing revenue growth. The **20.9% revenue increase in Singapore operations** and **24.9% increase in Malaysia operations** in FY2024 were "mainly due to higher sales in the medical and consumer segments/products" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.9]. The Group secured "new projects across a broad spectrum of industries, including medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances" and onboarded "global leaders in wound care and personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.5]. This indicates the Group's ability to attract and onboard high-value customers, underpinning the projected **20% Y-o-Y order book increase** by end of FY2024, which promises long-term sustainable revenue [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6]. While specific customer retention rates or market share data for these niches are not disclosed in the AR, the acquisition of global leaders and growth in high-value segments is a qualitative indicator of effective customer relationships and a growing reputation (brand strength) in these specialized areas.

### Critical Stance and Nuances

While Fu Yu's manufacturing segment demonstrates clear competitive advantages and improved operational performance, it is crucial to maintain a critical stance regarding the overall financial health and potential risks.

Despite positive developments in the manufacturing segment, the *Group as a whole remained loss-making*, reporting a **net loss of S$3.9 million in FY2024** [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8]. This indicates the turnaround is still in its early stages and overall profitability remains a significant challenge that may impact investor confidence and access to capital compared to profitable peers.

A notable red flag is the ongoing investigation into its discontinued Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) subsidiary. This investigation led to a **S$3.286 million impairment of goodwill** in FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, p.108] and, critically, resulted in a **qualified opinion from the external auditors** who stated they were "unable to determine the potential financial impact" of the ongoing claims related to FYSCS [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.103]. While management asserts this is "isolated solely to FYSCS" and "do not impact our continuing operations" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6], such an event introduces significant uncertainty and reputational risk, potentially diverting management's focus and affecting market perception and access to financing, thereby indirectly impacting its competitive positioning as a publicly traded entity.

The optimistic claims of "growth trajectory" and "long-term sustainable revenue" [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6] from the Chairman's message should be viewed in light of the thin profitability of the continuing operations (Profit before tax of S$0.15 million in FY2024) [Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8] and the overall group net loss. The ability to translate these advantages into consistent, substantial net profitability for the entire Group remains a key challenge for the next 12 months.
