### c. Disconnects Between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While Fu Yu's corporate strategies largely support its strategic objectives, one area shows a short-term gap:

*   **Environmental Sustainability Performance:** The strategic objective of reducing Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% by FY2030 has a short-term target of 3.0% for FY2024. However, the Group only achieved a 1.4% reduction in Scope 2 carbon emissions in FY2024, falling short of this short-term target [FY2024] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.41]. While the corporate strategy includes relevant initiatives like installing solar panels [FY2024] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6] and exploring cleaner energy solutions [FY2024] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.16], the pace or scale of these current strategic actions (e.g., solar panel initiatives extending into Q2 FY2025 [Q4 2024 - Q2 2025] | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.47]) did not fully align with the ambitious immediate objective, leading to the reported shortfall. This indicates a potential disconnect between the current efficacy of the strategy and the short-term goal.
