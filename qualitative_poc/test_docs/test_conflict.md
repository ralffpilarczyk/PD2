# Conflict Test Company

## Market Position
We are the market leader in our sector with the largest customer base.

## Regulatory Environment
However, we face heavy regulation that prevents any pricing flexibility. The government strictly controls prices in our industry, eliminating our ability to raise prices despite our dominant position.

## Operational Status
The company benefits from significant economies of scale due to our size, but paradoxically we also lack economies of scale in new digital channels where we are subscale.
