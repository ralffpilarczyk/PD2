Fu Yu Corporation Limited has demonstrated a notable operational turnaround in its core manufacturing business over the last 24 months, driven by strategic shifts towards higher-value segments and enhanced efficiency. The most impactful operating metrics are the growth in Manufacturing Revenue, significant expansion in Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin, and a substantial reduction in Employee Turnover Rate, collectively indicating a healthier, more stable, and strategically aligned operational performance despite the cessation of its supply chain management services.

### **1. Manufacturing Revenue (Continuing Operations)**

**Definition:** Manufacturing Revenue represents the total sales generated from the Group's core business of producing high-end precision plastic and metal components and products.

**Historical data with trends:**
*   **1H2023:** S$52.6 million (Fuyu Pres H124, Page 5, "1H2024 Review – Revenue")
*   **2H2023:** S$51.3 million (Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 15, Note 11(i))
*   **1H2024:** S$54.8 million (Fuyu Pres H124, Page 5, "1H2024 Review – Revenue")
*   **2H2024:** S$60.1 million (Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 15, Note 11(i))

**Trends:** The manufacturing revenue shows a positive upward trend over the last 24 months, growing from S$52.6 million in 1H2023 to S$60.1 million in 2H2024. On a full-year basis, manufacturing revenue grew by 10.5% from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024, indicating strong recovery and growth in the core business. This growth was particularly notable in the Singapore and Malaysia operations, which saw increases of 20.9% and 24.9% respectively in FY2024, offsetting a decline in China operations.

**Drivers and sustainability analysis:** The growth in manufacturing revenue is primarily driven by securing new projects in higher-margin segments like biomedical and consumer, coupled with higher order volumes from existing customers. The Group's strategic transformation, including the establishment of its Smart Factory with advanced tooling and cleanroom capabilities, has enabled these project wins. The sustainability of this trend is supported by the "sticky" nature of high-precision tooling projects, a 20% year-on-year increase in the order book at the end of FY2024, and the ability to offer geographical flexibility amidst geopolitical shifts.

**Financial impact:** The 10.5% increase in manufacturing revenue for FY2024 (S$11.0 million absolute increase) directly contributed to the Group's top-line growth and was a key factor in narrowing the net loss from S$10.1 million in FY2023 to S$3.9 million in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message").

**2 specific DD questions:**
1.  What is the current breakdown of the manufacturing order book by sector (e.g., biomedical, consumer, automotive) for the next 12-24 months, and what is the anticipated average unit price or revenue per project for these new orders?
2.  Can the company provide a list of top 5-10 manufacturing customers (by revenue or volume) for FY2023 and FY2024, indicating revenue contribution and whether they are new or existing customers, to assess customer concentration risk and new customer acquisition effectiveness?

### **2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**

**Definition:** Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin indicates the profitability of the Group's core manufacturing operations, representing the percentage of revenue left after accounting for the cost of goods sold.

**Historical data with trends:**
*   **1H2023:** 9.0% (Fuyu Pres H124, Page 6, "1H2024 Review – Gross and Net Profit")
*   **2H2023:** 11.56% (Derived from Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 4: 2H23 Gross Profit S$5,934K / 2H23 Revenue S$51,323K)
*   **1H2024:** 15.5% (Fuyu Pres H124, Page 6, "1H2024 Review – Gross and Net Profit")
*   **2H2024:** 14.08% (Derived from Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 4: 2H24 Gross Profit S$8,471K / 2H24 Revenue S$60,138K)

**Trends:** The manufacturing GPM shows a significant upward trend, rising from 9.0% in 1H2023 to 15.5% in 1H2024, before slightly moderating to 14.08% in 2H2024. On a full-year basis, the manufacturing GPM improved from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message").

**Drivers and sustainability analysis:** The improved GPM is primarily driven by higher-margin project wins in segments like medical devices and smart appliances, coupled with enhanced operational efficiencies. Initiatives such as the introduction of the New Product Introduction (NPI) team and increased automation in the Smart Factory contribute to better cost management and higher precision. The sustainability of this improved margin relies on the continued shift towards high-precision, higher-value products and ongoing investments in Industry 4.0 machinery and efficiency improvements.

**Financial impact:** The 1.8 percentage point improvement in manufacturing GPM from FY2023 (11.7%) to FY2024 (13.5%) translated to an additional S$2.07 million in gross profit on FY2024's manufacturing revenue of S$114.9 million (calculated as 1.8% of S$114.9 million), directly contributing to the narrowed net loss and improved EBITDA (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "Chairman's Message").

**2 specific DD questions:**
1.  What is the breakdown of manufacturing gross profit margin by product segment (e.g., life sciences, medical, consumer) for FY2023 and FY2024, and what initiatives are in place to sustain or further improve margins for lower-margin products?
2.  How does the company manage raw material price volatility, and what impact have these fluctuations had on manufacturing GPM over the last 24 months, particularly concerning any specific raw material types?

### **3. Employee Turnover Rate**

**Definition:** Employee Turnover Rate measures the percentage of the total workforce that departs from the company within a specified financial year.

**Historical data with trends:**
*   **FY2022:** 59.7% (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 51, "SR Employment", Table "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate", Total row for Turnover Rate)
*   **FY2023:** 63.8% (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 51, "SR Employment", Table "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate", Total row for Turnover Rate)
*   **FY2024:** 24.9% (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 51, "SR Employment", text description below the table)

**Trends:** The employee turnover rate shows a significant and positive turnaround, decreasing sharply from a high of 63.8% in FY2023 to 24.9% in FY2024. This trend indicates a marked improvement in employee retention over the last 24 months, particularly in the most recent year.

**Drivers and sustainability analysis:** The substantial reduction in turnover can be attributed to the Group's focus on employee well-being, competitive remuneration, and structured training and development programs. The shift in company priorities and potential re-structuring after ceasing the supply chain management segment might also have played a role in stabilizing the workforce. The sustainability of this lower turnover rate will depend on the continued investment in human capital development, fostering a positive work environment, and maintaining competitive compensation practices, as the Group's goal is to keep the rate below 30% (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 51, "SR Employment").

**Financial impact:** While direct financial quantification is complex without internal data on replacement costs, a reduction from 63.8% to 24.9% turnover significantly reduces costs associated with recruitment, onboarding, and training of new hires, as well as preserving institutional knowledge and reducing productivity losses. This improved stability directly enhances operational efficiency and product quality, indirectly contributing to margin expansion and customer satisfaction.

**2 specific DD questions:**
1.  Can the company provide a breakdown of the employee turnover rate by geographical location (Singapore, Malaysia, China) and by employee category (e.g., workers, executive level, management) for FY2023 and FY2024, to identify specific areas of retention success or concern?
2.  What specific retention initiatives (e.g., compensation adjustments, career development programs, work-life balance initiatives) were most impactful in reducing the turnover rate from FY2023 to FY2024, and how are these being scaled across the Group?
