### C. Disconnects & Critical Analysis

While the Group presents an optimistic outlook and clear strategic direction, a critical review reveals several areas of disconnects and potential red flags:

1.  **Disconnect between Strategic Objectives (Goals) and Financial Performance:**
    *   The Chairman's Message states the Group is "clearly on a growth trajectory" and highlights "early successes" in its strategic transformation, leading to a "sharp improvement" in the core manufacturing segment (FY2024 AR, p.5-6, Chairman's Message). However, the Group's continuing operations still recorded a net loss of S$1.2 million in FY2024, albeit narrowed from S$7.6 million in FY2023 (FY2024 AR, p.9, Income Statement Summary). The overall Group net loss was S$3.9 million in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p.9, Income Statement Summary). This suggests that while positive shifts are occurring, they have not yet translated into overall profitability for the core business, challenging the optimistic "growth trajectory" claim in the near term.

2.  **Disconnect in Human Capital Investment for Operational Excellence:**
    *   The strategic objective to achieve "operational excellence through advanced automation and digital transformation" (e.g., increasing toolroom automation to reduce downtime by 40%) implicitly requires a highly skilled workforce, likely necessitating significant training in new technologies and processes.
    *   **However, the average training hours per employee *decreased* from 16 hours in FY2023 to 13.2 hours in FY2024.** This reduction is attributed to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" (FY2024 AR, p.56, Training and Education). This is a significant red flag. A reduction in training hours directly contradicts the need for enhanced capabilities to support automation and high-precision manufacturing, potentially hindering future capability development and the achievement of strategic objectives. This indicates a potential underinvestment in human capital or misaligned priorities.

3.  **Underperformance on Short-Term Sustainability Targets:**
    *   The Group set a short-term target to reduce Scope 2 carbon emissions by 3.0% in FY2024 (using FY2023 as baseline).
    *   **However, the actual reduction achieved was only 1.4%** (FY2024 AR, p.40, Sustainability Report). While a reduction was achieved, missing a stated short-term target suggests challenges in execution or perhaps an overly ambitious initial target. This warrants closer monitoring of future sustainability performance.

4.  **Impact of Discontinued Operations and Investigations on Resource Reallocation and Reputation:**
    *   The decision to cease the Supply Chain Management Services Segment (FYSCS) was explicitly made to "reallocate resources to our core manufacturing business" (FY2024 AR, p.6, Chairman's Message; p.17, Sustainability Report).
    *   **However, this cessation is intertwined with ongoing investigations into "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process" and "purported misuse of FYSCS's resources," leading to a qualified audit opinion for FY2024** (FY2024 AR, p.6, Chairman's Message; p.104, Independent Auditor's Report; p.100, Risk Management Report; p.101, Directors' Statement). This raises questions about the effectiveness of past resource allocation and internal controls, and while the Group states it's "isolated solely to FYSCS," it casts a shadow over overall corporate governance and financial integrity, potentially impacting investor confidence and capital availability (FY2024 AR, p.33, Reputation). The timing of the positive announcement of resource reallocation coinciding with the revelation of serious internal control issues (Internal Audit Report in August 2024, investigation initiated October 2024, findings announced February 2025) should be questioned.

5.  **Optimistic Narrative vs. Operational Challenges:**
    *   The company highlights increased order books (20% year-on-year for FY2024) and positive momentum for 2H2024 (FY2024 FS Q424, p.29, Outlook). Yet, the 2H2024 revenue for the Group actually *decreased* by 45.8% compared to 2H2023 (due to supply chain management services cessation), and the Group incurred a net loss of S$3.964 million in 2H2024 (FY2024 FS Q424, p.4, Condensed interim consolidated income statement). This suggests a strong reliance on the discontinued segment for top-line performance in prior periods and that the manufacturing segment's growth, while positive, is not yet sufficient to offset the overall impact.
