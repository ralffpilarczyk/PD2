## SECTION 13: Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

### Introduction

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or the "Group"), a major Asian manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components, initiated a strategic transformation in FY2023. Its FY2024 strategic direction has been shaped by significant internal and external challenges, including geopolitical shifts and an ongoing investigation into a discontinued business segment.

### a. Strategic Objectives

Strategic objectives are the forward-looking goals the company aims to achieve. Fu Yu's objectives for upcoming periods are derived from its vision, mission, chairman's message, and sustainability report.

1.  **Objective: Deepen Focus on High-Precision Manufacturing and Value Chain Advancement**
    *   **Goal & Timeframe:** To concentrate on core high-precision manufacturing capabilities, including advanced tooling, 3D metal printing, and cleanroom operations. This aims to stabilize 5-micron precision levels, move to higher levels, and secure long-term, higher-margin projects [AR, p.3, p.5; FS Q424, p.30]. Automation levels are targeted to reduce downtime by 40% from FY2025 [AR, p.5].
    *   **Metrics & Resources:** Success is evidenced by a 20% year-on-year increase in FY2024 order book and securing new projects in high-margin sectors like medical devices and drone technology [AR, p.5; FS Q424, p.30]. This is supported by FY2024 capital expenditure of S$6.9 million primarily for factory equipment, investment in the flagship Singapore Smart Factory (9,348 sqm, Industry 4.0), and introduction of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team [AR, p.5, p.9; FS Q424, p.29].

2.  **Objective: Achieve Financial Turnaround and Sustainable Profitability**
    *   **Goal & Timeframe:** To improve financial performance, moving from net losses to profitability by increasing revenue, enhancing gross profit margins, and managing costs effectively, with an optimistic outlook for FY2025 [AR, p.5, p.8; FS Q424, p.30].
    *   **Metrics & Resources:** Demonstrated by a 10.5% revenue growth from continuing operations to S$114.9 million in FY2024, gross profit margin improvement to 13.5% for manufacturing, and a sharp reduction in net loss for continuing operations to S$1.2 million (from S$7.6 million) [AR, p.5, p.8; FS Q424, p.4]. This is supported by reallocation of resources to core manufacturing and cost-containment measures, notably a 20.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses [AR, p.5, p.8; FS Q424, p.29].

3.  **Objective: Advance Sustainability and Environmental Stewardship**
    *   **Goal & Timeframe:** To embed sustainable practices and reduce carbon footprint, with a medium-term target to reduce Scope 2 emissions by 30% by FY2030 (from FY2023 baseline) and a short-term target of 3.0% reduction for FY2024 [SR, p.3, p.40].
    *   **Metrics & Resources:** Achieved a 1.1% reduction in total GHG emissions, a 1.4% reduction in Scope 2 carbon emissions, and a 9.1% decrease in total water consumption in FY2024 [SR, p.39, p.40, p.42]. Investments include solar panel installations in Singapore and Malaysia, replacing hydraulic machinery with electric alternatives, and exploring biodegradable bio-resins [AR, p.5; SR, p.31, p.32, p.37].

### b. Corporate Strategies

Corporate strategies define how the company leverages its existing assets and capabilities to compete effectively *now*.

1.  **Strategy: Leverage Vertically-Integrated Manufacturing for "One-Stop Solution"**
    *   **Definition & Capabilities:** Fu Yu positions itself as a comprehensive manufacturing partner, offering end-to-end services from product design to final assembly. This is achieved through over 45 years of precision engineering expertise, 6 strategic manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China (over 1.5 million sqft capacity), specialized facilities like the Smart Factory (high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, cleanroom), and a New Product Introduction (NPI) team [AR, p.3, p.5; SR, p.18].
    *   **Competitive & Historical Context:** Established since 1978, this core business model enables Fu Yu to build long-term customer partnerships and differentiate itself in a competitive industry by providing a seamless, integrated solution to a diverse customer base across various sectors [AR, p.3; SR, p.18].

2.  **Strategy: Provide Geographical Flexibility to Mitigate Geopolitical Risks**
    *   **Definition & Capabilities:** Fu Yu offers manufacturing solutions across multiple countries (Singapore, Malaysia, China) to provide customers with supply chain resilience and options to diversify production away from single-country risks, particularly China. This leverages its existing operational footprint and established local networks in each region [AR, p.3, p.5, p.14].
    *   **Competitive & Historical Context:** This strategy is a direct response to "geopolitical uncertainty" and customers seeking to "source production away from China" [AR, p.5]. China operations, which contributed 35.0% of manufacturing revenue in FY2023, reduced to 27.9% in FY2024, demonstrating an active shift in revenue mix aligned with this strategy [AR, p.5, p.9].

3.  **Strategy: Customer-Centric Engagement and Relationship Building**
    *   **Definition & Capabilities:** The Group actively engages with customers from early product lifecycle stages (e.g., product design, NPI) to build strong, long-term partnerships and ensure confidence in scaling production and maintaining quality. This includes a dedicated NPI team, advanced tooling, high-precision capabilities, and proactive engagement methods like regular meetings and satisfaction surveys [AR, p.3, p.5; SR, p.24].
    *   **Competitive & Historical Context:** This strategy enhances "value add to customers" and fosters "mutually beneficial long-term partnerships" [AR, p.3]. Recent project wins across diverse industries (medical devices, drone technology, smart appliances) demonstrate its effectiveness in attracting new customers beyond traditional segments [AR, p.5].

### Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While Fu Yu presents a coherent strategic direction, several notable disconnects emerge when challenging optimistic claims and considering other available information:

1.  **FYSCS Scandal vs. Corporate Governance & Strategic Focus:**
    *   **Objective/Claim:** To uphold "highest standards of corporate governance" and strategically reallocate resources to core manufacturing [AR, p.5; FS Q424, p.29].
    *   **Reality:** The discontinuation of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) is optimistically framed, but documents reveal an *ongoing investigation into significant weaknesses in FYSCS's risk management, fraud risks, and potential misuse of resources* [AR, p.7, p.99, p.103; FS Q424, p.26-27]. This major governance failure, impacting 39.9% of previous total revenue, directly contradicts claims of high corporate governance. The auditor's *qualified opinion* based on this investigation [AR, p.104], coupled with a substantial shareholder's requisition to *remove two incumbent independent directors and appoint four new ones* [AR, p.183-184], highlights deep internal dissatisfaction with oversight.

2.  **"Growth Trajectory" vs. Financial Performance & Market Challenges:**
    *   **Objective/Claim:** The Chairman asserts Fu Yu is "clearly on a growth trajectory" and has an "optimistic" outlook for FY2025 [AR, p.5; FS Q424, p.30].
    *   **Reality:** Despite improvements in continuing operations, the Group *remains in a net loss position* for FY2024 (S$3.9 million total net loss) [AR, p.8; FS Q424, p.4]. Crucially, 2H2024 Group revenue *decreased* by 45.8% compared to 2H2023, largely due to the FYSCS discontinuation [FS Q424, p.29]. This indicates that the "growth trajectory" is more aspirational than definitively established, especially amidst a "challenging operating environment" and "geopolitical tensions" [FS Q424, p.30].

3.  **Talent Development & Retention vs. Practice:**
    *   **Objective/Claim:** "Strategic recruitment, retention, and development of human capital is of utmost importance" [SR, p.57].
    *   **Reality:** The FY2024 employee turnover rate was 24.9% [SR, p.51]. Furthermore, average training hours per employee *decreased* from 16 hours (FY2023) to 13.2 hours (FY2024) due to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" [SR, p.57]. This suggests a disconnect where stated importance of human capital does not fully align with actual resource allocation or outcomes.

### Conclusion

Fu Yu's strategic objectives for the foreseeable future are clearly centered on strengthening its high-precision manufacturing core, achieving financial turnaround, and deepening its commitment to sustainability. Its corporate strategies, particularly leveraging its vertically-integrated model and geographical flexibility, appear well-aligned with these objectives, especially in the context of global supply chain shifts.

However, significant disconnects emerge. The severe FYSCS investigation, evidenced by an auditor's qualified opinion and attempts to remove board members, gravely undermines confidence in management's governance and execution credibility. Despite positive signs from continuing manufacturing operations, the Group remains loss-making, making the "growth trajectory" more an aspiration than a reality, particularly given the immediate impact of the FYSCS exit on overall revenue. Furthermore, declining employee training hours and high turnover challenge the practical implementation of human capital development strategies. Investors should closely monitor the FYSCS investigation's outcome and the ongoing board dynamics, as these will be critical determinants of the Group's future strategic execution and financial health.
