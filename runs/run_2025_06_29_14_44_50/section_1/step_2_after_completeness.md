**Analysis:**
The total employee headcount has decreased by 7.8% from FY2023 to FY2024 and by 10.6% since FY2022, indicating a leaner operational structure. This reduction is primarily driven by a significant decrease in China operations headcount (from 694 in FY2023 to 530 in FY2024), aligning with the Group's strategic shift away from China-centric production. Conversely, the Singapore workforce has expanded from 429 to 484, reflecting the emphasis on the Smart Factory and higher-value activities in Singapore. No interim period data for employee headcount or dynamics is available in the provided reports.

While the new hire rate and turnover rate have significantly decreased from FY2023, the turnover rate of 24.9% in FY2024 remains substantial, though the Group aims for it to be below 30% (exclusive of temporary workers) in the future. This high turnover, combined with a reduction in average training hours per employee (from 16.0 in FY2023 to 13.2 in FY2024), presents a potential non-financial risk (Learned Analytical Instruction 1). Reduced training and high turnover could impact employee morale, lead to a loss of institutional knowledge, and potentially degrade customer service or product quality, especially in high-precision manufacturing where specialized skills are critical. Management's commentary attributes the reduction to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" (FY24 AR, p.56), which could be a red flag if skill development is deprioritized for short-term cost savings.

The Group maintains a near 1:1 male to female employee ratio overall. However, a more granular look at employee categories in FY2024 reveals a gender imbalance at senior levels (80% male in Senior Management) compared to worker levels (53.7% female). The workforce is predominantly aged 30-50 (61.4% overall), which aligns with industry norms and promotes a diverse workforce.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

The Group's geographic footprint, encompassing Singapore, Malaysia, and China, is actively being re-aligned to mitigate geopolitical risks and capitalize on new market opportunities.

**Manufacturing Revenue Contribution by Geography:**

| Region    | FY2024 (S$M) | 2H24 (S$M) | 1H24 (S$M) | FY2023 (S$M) | 2H23 (S$M) | 1H23 (S$M) | FY2024 Contribution (%) | FY2023 Contribution (%) | Change in Contribution (ppt) | Most Recent Value & Date | Source                                                               |
| :-------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Singapore | 46.2         | 25.2       | 21.0       | 38.2         | 18.5       | 19.7       | 40.2%                   | 36.8%                   | +3.4                         | 46.2M (FY2024)           | FY24 AR, p.8; FS Q424, p.17; Pres 1H24, p.5                         |
| Malaysia  | 36.6         | 18.8       | 17.8       | 29.3         | 16.5       | 12.8       | 31.9%                   | 28.2%                   | +3.7                         | 36.6M (FY2024)           | FY24 AR, p.8; FS Q424, p.17; Pres 1H24, p.5                         |
| China     | 32.1         | 16.1       | 16.0       | 36.4         | 16.3       | 20.1       | 27.9%                   | 35.0%                   | -7.1                         | 32.1M (FY2024)           | FY24 AR, p.8; FS Q424, p.17; Pres 1H24, p.5                         |

**Analysis:**
The shift in revenue contribution clearly demonstrates the Group's strategic re-alignment. Singapore and Malaysia operations are gaining prominence, with their combined contribution to manufacturing revenue increasing by 7.1 percentage points from FY2023 to FY2024. This directly offsets the 7.1 percentage point decline from China operations. The interim data further highlights this trend: while China's contribution remained relatively stable in 1H24 and 2H24, Singapore and Malaysia showed consistent growth, particularly Malaysia with a 39.1% increase in 1H24 revenue compared to 1H23. This geographical diversification is a direct response to "geopolitical uncertainty" and customers seeking to "source production away from China" (FY24 AR, p.6), showcasing the Group's agility in adapting to external market trends (Learned Analytical Instruction 2). The Singapore-headquartered status with production in three countries offers a compelling "geographical flexibility" advantage to customers (FY24 AR, p.6).

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

Several significant changes and trends are evident in the Group's operating footprint in recent periods:

*   **Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):** The Group ceased all business activities in FYSCS in the last quarter of FY2024 (FY24 AR, p.6). This segment contributed 39.9% of total Group revenue in FY2024 (FY24 AR, p.8). Management states this was to "reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business" and due to "inability to identify a suitable candidate" (FS Q424, p.26). However, an ongoing investigation into "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process" and "purported misuse of FYSCS's resources" (FY24 AR, p.6, p.172) reveals a critical underlying issue. The external auditor has issued a qualified opinion on the financial statements due to the ongoing investigation into FYSCS, stating they were "unable to determine the potential financial impact" (FY24 AR, p.104). This suggests the cessation was not solely a strategic resource reallocation but also a necessary divestment of a problematic segment, a disconnect between management's positive framing and the underlying data (Critical Stance).
*   **Strategic Shift in Manufacturing Focus:** The Group is increasingly focusing on high-precision manufacturing, securing new projects in medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances (FY24 AR, p.6). The launch of Fu Yu Biomedical in 2023 further solidifies this direction (FY24 AR, p.2).
*   **Increased Automation and Technology Adoption:** Investment in the Smart Factory, implementation of Industry 4.0 machinery, 3D metal printing, and near-completion of an ERP integrated cloud-based IT platform (FY24 AR, p.6). The goal is to reduce downtime by 40% and enable overnight/weekend production (FY24 AR, p.6).
*   **Sustainability Integration:** Significant efforts in reducing energy and water consumption, and waste generation. No interim data is available for these metrics.
    *   **Energy Consumption:** Decreased by 2.5% (purchased electricity) in FY2024 vs FY2023 (FY24 AR, p.36). Total energy consumed (including solar) was 119,942.0 GJ in FY2024 (FY24 AR, p.37).
    *   **Water Consumption:** Decreased by 9.1% in FY2024 vs FY2023 (FY24 AR, p.42). Total water consumed was 89.1 MegaLiter in FY2024 (FY24 AR, p.42).
    *   **Waste Generation:** Hazardous waste reduced by 25.7% in FY2024 (FY24 AR, p.45). Non-hazardous waste also declined due to production efficiency and initiatives like reusable containers and paperless documentation (FY24 AR, p.45).
*   **Order Book Growth:** The order book increased by 20% year-on-year at the end of FY2024, driven by higher order volumes and new project wins (FY24 AR, p.6). This indicates positive traction in the core manufacturing business.
*   **Customer Concentration:** The Group's revenue in FY2024 was derived from 3 external customers who individually contributed 10% or more of the Group's revenue, compared to only 1 such customer in FY2023 (FY24 AR, p.170). This indicates a slight diversification in major customer reliance, though the total number of customers is not disclosed.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The Group's operating structure, characterized by its integrated services, advanced capabilities, and strategic geographic positioning, significantly enhances its competitive standing.

*   **Vertical Integration ("One-Stop Solution"):** Offering product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing (FY24 AR, p.2) allows the Group to provide comprehensive solutions, enhancing customer value-add and fostering long-term partnerships (FY24 AR, p.2). This "sticky" nature of projects involving high-precision tooling is expected to translate into long-term sustainable revenue (FY24 AR, p.6).
*   **Technological Advancement & Precision Engineering:** The Singapore Smart Factory's capabilities in complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and cleanroom manufacturing (FY24 AR, p.2) position the Group at the high-end of the precision engineering market. The continuous pursuit of 5-micron precision levels and higher (FY24 AR, p.6) directly supports its focus on high-margin sectors like medical and biomedical.
*   **Geographical Flexibility & Risk Mitigation:** With manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China, and a Singapore-headquartered status, the Group offers "geographical flexibility" (FY24 AR, p.6). This is a crucial competitive advantage in an environment where customers seek to diversify supply chains away from China due to geopolitical uncertainties (Learned Analytical Instruction 2). The observed shift in revenue contribution, particularly the consistent growth in Singapore and Malaysia, reflects successful adaptation to this external trend.
*   **Operational Efficiency & Sustainability:** Investments in energy-efficient machinery, solar panels, and water/waste reduction initiatives (FY24 AR, p.36-45) not only reduce operational costs but also enhance the Group's appeal to increasingly sustainability-conscious customers and partners. ISO and IATF certifications across its facilities (FY24 AR, p.15) further validate its commitment to quality, environmental, and automotive industry standards, strengthening its reputation as a trusted manufacturing partner.
*   **Challenges and Risks:** While the strategic pivot and operational improvements are positive, the high employee turnover and reduced training hours (as noted in section 'a') could pose a long-term risk to maintaining high-precision capabilities and customer service quality, especially given the critical need for specialized skills in precision manufacturing. The cessation of FYSCS, while strategically beneficial in focusing on core business, also highlights past internal control weaknesses (FY24 AR, p.172) that have led to a qualified audit opinion and ongoing investigations. These issues could impact reputation and investor confidence if not thoroughly resolved, underscoring a disconnect between management's narrative and the underlying financial and operational realities.
