### C. Employee Distribution and Human Resources

The Group's workforce composition and management practices highlight its commitment to human capital development and workplace safety.

**Employee Distribution**

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Source |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Total Employees** | 1,372 | 1,488 | 1,535 | AR, p.49, "Total Number of Employees, By Gender and Region" |
| *Note: FY2022 and FY2023 employee numbers include outsourced workers which are excluded from FY2024, making direct comparison of new hire and turnover rates difficult.* | | | | AR, p.49, Footnote 12 |

**Employee Breakdown (FY2024)**

*   **By Type:** Permanent: 1,241; Temporary: 131 [AR, p.48, "Employment"]
*   **By Gender:** Male: 686 (50%); Female: 686 (50%) [AR, p.49, "Total Number of Employees, By Gender and Region"]

### D. Significant Changes and Trends in the Operating Footprint

The Group's operating footprint has undergone significant shifts reflecting strategic transformation and market responses.

*   **Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):** The Group ceased all business activities in FYSCS in the last quarter of FY2024 to reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business. This segment accounted for 39.9% of total Group revenue in FY2024 (down from 45.4% in FY2023). [AR, p.9, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW"; AR, p.6, "FU YU SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS"]
    *   **Critical Stance:** Management states the reason for cessation as "inability to identify a suitable candidate" [FS, p.26, Note 15], which appears to downplay the severity given the simultaneous disclosure of an ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs, highlighting "significant weaknesses" in its risk management process and "unverifiable arrangements" involving a US$2.98M payment, unauthorized email usage, and irregular expense claims. The auditor's opinion on the financial statements is qualified due to the ongoing investigation into FYSCS. [AR, p.6, "FU YU SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS"; AR Financial Contents, p.100, "Directors' Statement", p.104, "Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements - Basis for Qualified Opinion", p.171-172, Note 32 "Ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd."; FS, p.26, Note 15] This suggests a deeper, more systemic issue rather than just a personnel gap.
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing & Automation:**
    *   **Smart Factory Development:** Investment in the flagship Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1, Singapore) with Industry 4.0 machinery, including 3D metal printing and a 100K-class cleanroom. [AR, p.5, "Forward Strategies"]
    *   **Automation Focus:** Aiming to increase automation levels in toolroom to enable overnight and weekend production, potentially reducing downtime by 40%. Progressively replacing hydraulic machinery with electric alternatives to enhance efficiency and reduce oil consumption. [AR, p.6, "Conclusion and Outlook"; SR, p.32, "Transitional Risk"; SR, p.47, "Innovative Production"]
    *   **Digital Transformation:** Completion of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform testing, and transition to a paperless mould-making process. [AR, p.6, "Conclusion and Outlook"; SR, p.47, "Innovative Production"]
    *   **Precision Enhancement:** Stabilizing high-precision products at the 5-micron level and moving towards even higher precision. [AR, p.6, "Conclusion and Outlook"]
*   **Renewable Energy Integration:** Installation of solar panels on facility rooftops in Singapore (completed FY2024), Johor (operational Q4 FY2024), and Penang (operational Q2 FY2025) to generate up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy. [AR, p.5, "Forward Strategies"; SR, p.47, "Renewable Energy"]
*   **Waste and Water Management Improvements:** Decreased total water consumption by 9.1% in FY2024 (89.1 Megaliter). Reduced hazardous waste production by 25.7% in FY2024. Implemented rainwater harvesting and increased use of reusable containers, saving over 300 tonnes of paper annually in Singapore. [SR, p.42-45, "Water Consumption", "Waste", "Paper Usage Reduction"]

### G. Critical Observations and Red Flags

1.  **FYSCS Discrepancy:** The stated reason for discontinuing FYSCS ("inability to identify a suitable candidate") appears to be a management spin, given the accompanying disclosure of an ongoing investigation into "significant weaknesses" in its risk management, "unverifiable arrangements" leading to a multi-million dollar payment, and "irregular expense claims." This indicates a fundamental governance and operational failure rather than merely a human resource issue. The qualified audit opinion specifically highlights this as a major area of concern that auditors could not fully assess, leaving a significant unknown financial impact on the Group. [AR, p.6, p.100, p.171-172; FS, p.26]
2.  **Employee Data Comparability:** The restatement of historical employee numbers (FY2022 and FY2023) to exclude outsourced workers in FY2024 limits the direct comparability of new hire and turnover rates. This makes it difficult to assess true underlying trends in workforce stability or attraction/retention over the three-year period. Management's forward-looking target for turnover "exclusive of temporary workers" acknowledges this data limitation but limits backward analysis. [AR, p.49, p.51, footnotes 12 & 13]
3.  **Ambiguous Solar Energy Impact:** While solar panel installations are highlighted as a sustainability effort, the exact portion of energy consumption offset by these panels in FY2024 is not clearly quantifiable. The figures indicate solar energy was consumed (4,001.8 GJ) and some sold (216.1 GJ), but the total energy consumption (119,942.0 GJ) only showed a modest 2.5% decrease in purchased electricity compared to FY2023, while overall energy consumption slightly increased (1.0% with solar). This suggests the full impact or offset may not be as significant yet, or is not clearly presented. [AR, p.5, p.38]
4.  **Increasing Injury Rate:** Despite stated commitment to occupational health and safety, the "recordable work-related injuries rate" increased in FY2024. While specific incidents (cuts, contact with fan, slips) are mentioned, the overall upward trend warrants closer scrutiny to ensure preventive measures are effective and not merely "reiterated safety guidelines." [SR, p.60]
