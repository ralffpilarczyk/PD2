ANALYTICAL_INSTRUCTIONS:
- instruction: "When analyzing consolidated financials impacted by restructuring or reclassification, adapt the analysis timeframe to focus on periods where comparable data is consistently available for continuing operations, enabling meaningful trend analysis."
  section_number: 7
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When total revenue growth stagnates or declines, immediately break down revenue by continuing vs. discontinued/divested operations to identify diverging segment trends and their offsetting effects. This helps uncover true underlying business performance."

  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "For discontinued or divested segments, rigorously investigate rapid declines in revenue (e.g., near-total quarterly evaporation). Such dramatic shifts are major red flags suggesting unmanaged wind-down, misstatement, or severe operational issues, impacting overall financial visibility."

- instruction: "Always cross-examine annual profitability metrics (e.g., EBITDA Margin, Operating Margin) with interim (half-yearly/quarterly) trends for the core business. Significant interim erosion despite annual improvement often signals an unsustainable turnaround or a reversal of positive trends."

- instruction: "Assess cash conversion metrics (e.g., OCF/EBITDA) not only for annual improvement but also for extreme volatility across interim periods. High interim swings indicate inconsistent cash management and raise predictability concerns for future cash flows."

- instruction: "When a business segment is discontinued or divested, look beyond the immediate financial impact to investigate the underlying reasons. Analyze the event for broader implications concerning governance, internal controls, and potential mismanagement that necessitated the cessation."

- instruction: "When analyzing a company undergoing business transformation, assess the granularity and specificity of management guidance provided for the core continuing operations. A lack of specific, forward-looking guidance hinders effective accountability assessment and future strategic analysis."

  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "To provide a robust assessment of claimed 'improvements' or 'turnarounds', always seek and apply relevant industry benchmarks. This contextualizes the company's performance against competitors and the broader operating environment, preventing conclusions based solely on rebound from a low base."
  section_number: 7
  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "Systematically cross-reference critical financial metrics, especially non-GAAP measures like EBITDA, between management's high-level narratives (e.g., 'Financial Highlights') and detailed segment reporting or footnotes. Fundamental contradictions profoundly undermine management credibility and the reliability of all performance claims."
  section_number: 7
  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "Compare management's narrative concerning negative events (e.g., investigations, control weaknesses) with independent third-party assessments, especially qualified auditor opinions. Discrepancies often reveal downplayed risks, broader implications, and underlying governance failures beyond management's stated scope."
  section_number: 7
  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "When specific instances of internal control weaknesses or investigations are identified, analyze their potential broader implications for group-wide governance, control mechanisms, and investor trust, even if management frames them as isolated incidents."
