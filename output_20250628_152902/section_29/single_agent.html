        <li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> The provided documents do not offer specific competitor or industry average data for manufacturing gross profit margins. Therefore, outperformance or underperformance against industry benchmarks cannot be quantified. However, the Company itself highlights this GPM improvement as a key success metric for its core manufacturing segment<sup>23</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis of Drivers:</strong> The improvement in manufacturing GPM is primarily driven by:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategic Transformation & High-Precision Focus:</strong> The Company's strategic shift towards high-precision manufacturing and advanced tooling, along with new projects in biomedical and consumer segments, allows it to command higher unit pricing and capture higher-margin product categories<sup>24</sup>.</li>
                <li><strong>New Product Introduction (NPI) Team:</strong> The NPI team's ability to add value in the early stages of the business cycle has instilled confidence in new customers, particularly for higher-margin products, facilitating profitable project wins<sup>25</sup>.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Lower selling and administrative expenses, attributed to reduced employee costs, travelling, and utility charges, indirectly contribute to overall profitability, supporting margin expansion<sup>26</sup>. Investments in energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines, and upgrades to LED lighting also contribute to cost reduction<sup>27</sup>.</li>
                <li><strong>Cessation of Low-Margin Segment:</strong> The discontinuation of the low-margin supply chain management services segment (which had a gross profit margin of 1.9% in FY2024 compared to manufacturing's 13.5%) improved the overall Group GPM, allowing the manufacturing segment's strong performance to shine through more clearly<sup>28</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> The provided documents do not offer specific competitor or industry average data for CAPEX. Therefore, outperformance or underperformance against industry benchmarks cannot be quantified. However, the Company states its CAPEX is "mainly for the purchase of factory equipment, plant and machineries" and mentions its "flagship Smart Factory in Singapore is one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities," implying a commitment to staying competitive through investment<sup>36,37</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis of Drivers:</strong> The substantial increase in CAPEX is driven by:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategic Transformation & Technology Upgrades:</strong> The Company is investing in advanced manufacturing capabilities, such as Industry 4.0 machinery and replacing older hydraulic machines with energy-efficient electric alternatives, as part of its Smart Factory initiatives in Singapore. This enables complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, and 3D metal printing<sup>38,39,40</sup>.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity Expansion for New Projects:</strong> The CAPEX supports the scaling up of production for new projects secured in higher-margin categories like biomedical and consumer segments, and future projects for electric vehicles (EVs) and medical devices<sup>41,42</sup>.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency and Automation Initiatives:</strong> Investments aim to increase automation levels in the toolroom to reduce downtime by 40% and improve overall plant performance. Solar panel installations also contribute, aimed at reducing energy costs and carbon footprint<sup>43,44</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:</strong> The elevated CAPEX trend is sustainable given the Company's healthy balance sheet with net cash of S$55.5 million as at 31 December 2024<sup>45</sup>. This investment is a long-term strategic commitment to maintaining technological leadership and capturing future growth opportunities in high-value precision manufacturing. Factors that could affect this trend include changes in market demand that do not justify the investment, or a significant shift in the Company's strategic priorities away from capital-intensive technological upgrades.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantified Financial Impact:</strong> The increased CAPEX of S$6.94 million in FY2024 (a S$2.98 million increase from FY2023) represents a significant cash outflow from investing activities<sup>46</sup>. While a cost in the short term, this investment is expected to contribute to future revenue growth by enabling new project wins and capacity expansion, and to margin expansion by improving operational efficiency and reducing energy costs, thereby enhancing long-term economic performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>What is the expected ROI and payback period for the recent CAPEX investments, particularly those related to the Smart Factory automation and new machinery, and how are these investments tracked against their intended efficiency and capacity goals?</li>
                <li>Given the strategic focus on high-precision products, what percentage of future CAPEX is allocated to advanced tooling and biomedical cleanroom capabilities, and how does this align with the long-term revenue targets for these segments?</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
