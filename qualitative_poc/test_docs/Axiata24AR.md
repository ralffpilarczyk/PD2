## BASIS OF THIS REPORT

### **Reporting Philosophy**

The Axiata Group Berhad's ('Axiata', 'the Group', or 'Axiata Group') 2024 Integrated Annual Report (IAR) provides a concise overview of how we create and sustain value for stakeholders while managing risks. References to 'Axiata' or 'the Group' may also include its subsidiaries and operating companies (OpCos), where applicable. This year, we have combined our IAR and sustainability report, which was previously part of the Sustainability and National Contribution Report (SNCR), to provide a unified narrative of our progress toward becoming a leading Converged Connectivity Group. The National Contribution Report (NCR) will be published separately at a later date.

### **Scope and Boundary**

Axiata's 2024 Reporting Suite, which encompasses the IAR and GAFS, covers the Group's performance across its operating footprint in Southeast and South Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, Myanmar, the Philippines, as well as the broader geography covered by its digital advertising and analytics businesses. The reporting period covers 1 January to 31 December 2024, including significant events up to 31 March 2025, where material to our disclosures. These reports include performance reviews of our businesses in which Axiata exercises significant operational control with over 50% ownership ('Operating Companies' or 'OpCos').

## CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

# Creating Enduring Value

Axiata strengthened its role as a digital and financial enabler across Southeast and South Asia, driving connectivity, innovation and inclusion amid global geopolitical adjustments. The Group expanded digital access, empowered communities and advanced sustainability efforts, which reinforced its commitment to a more connected and resilient Asia.

**Tan Sri Shahril Ridza Ridzuan** Chairman

### **Dear Stakeholders,**

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the 'Board'), it is an honour to present Axiata Group Berhad's ('Axiata' or 'the Group') progress over the past year, reflecting on the strides made in strengthening financial resilience, driving digital inclusion and advancing sustainable growth across its markets.

### **Navigating a Dynamic Landscape**

The year 2024 witnessed significant global economic shifts, including geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, high interest rates and evolving regulatory landscapes. Asia, however, demonstrated resilience, driven by strong domestic consumption, accelerating digital adoption and strengthening of infrastructure investments.

With rapid digitalisation, the need for fast connectivity and business solutions is growing. To succeed, telecom companies must invest wisely in their networks, have scalable presence, build strong partnerships and adapt quickly in an increasingly dynamic industry. Across the region, the telecommunications sector continued its transformation, with industry consolidation emerging as a defining theme, shaping market structures into more sustainable three-player models across the region and investing into 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) opportunities.

**Strengthening Our Market Leadership** 

Amidst a rapidly changing landscape, Axiata and its operating companies (OpCos) in Southeast and South Asia have focused on expanding digital and financial access. We are driving technologyled economic growth and supporting national digital agendas. As governments push for digitalisation, businesses adopt AI, cloud and 5G, and consumers demand seamless connectivity, Axiata is committed to delivering top-tier digital solutions, fuelling Asia's next growth phase.

Leveraging our strong presence across diverse markets, we're continuously enhancing connectivity, expanding digital financial services and reinforcing our telecommunications infrastructure, creating a solid platform for future growth.

In 2023, we launched a transformation journey guided by our 5\*5 Strategy, aimed at maximising long-term value. This involved streamlining our portfolio, strengthening our financial stability and accelerating digital innovation to meet the demands of an increasingly connected world. Our clear growth strategy enables us to maximise value in core markets, capitalise on industry consolidation and evolve into a leading Telco-TechCo company.

The results are evident. In 2024, we solidified our market leadership through effective execution and strategic enhancements. The CelcomDigi merger in Malaysia delivered strong synergies ahead of schedule, reinforcing its position as the country's leading telco. Smooth integration is paving the way for further efficiencies and improved service. In Indonesia, XL Axiata's consolidation efforts with the intent to merge with Smartfren will strengthen its competitive edge and market standing. Beyond connectivity, Boost launched its digital bank, expanding financial access for underserved communities and small businesses. Furthermore, the Group's disciplined capital management in key frontier markets has strengthened our financial resilience, ensuring long-term stability.

**IAR,** Our Strategy on page 22 and 5 Vectors Of Value Creation on pages 33 to 35

### **Financial and Shareholder Value Creation**

Axiata stayed committed to financial resilience, successfully reducing debt and strengthening its balance sheet to ensure long-term stability. Through disciplined capital management, the Group continues to balance innovation and financial stewardship while enabling sustainable growth to deliver shareholder returns.

In line with its aspiration to be a Sustainable Dividend Company, Axiata maintained its commitment to sustainable dividends. For 2024, the Group declared a dividend of 10.0 sen per share (DPS), reflecting its ability to generate strong cash flows while pursuing strategic investments for future value creation.

## CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

### **Advancing Sustainability**

As environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations drive investment and business strategies, Axiata prioritises building a greener digital economy, building future-ready talent and expanding digital and financial access to strengthen communities. With a clear focus on digital transformation, operational efficiency and sustainable growth, the Group is wellpositioned to support national development goals and drive long-term economic resilience.

To strengthen its efforts on climate-related disclosures, the Group's net-zero targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in June 2024, reaffirming its commitment to reducing carbon emissions. Axiata is also preparing to align its reporting with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 (General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainabilityrelated Financial Information) and IFRS S2 *(*Climate-related Disclosures) to ensure greater transparency and accountability in its climate-related efforts.

Axiata maintained its FTSE Russell ESG Rating at 3.4 and its 3-star ESG Grading Band in the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index and retained an AA (Leader) rating from MSCI ESG Ratings in 2024.

### **Robust Governance Driving Value**

Strong governance is essential for Axiata's long-term success. The Board of Directors is committed to guiding the Group's vision, setting clear strategic priorities and ensuring all subsidiaries operate with accountability and efficiency. We continuously refine our governance structure, improve decision-making and drive operational excellence throughout the organisation.

Prudent capital management will always be a key priority to ensure that financial resources are optimally deployed to balance liquidity, fuel sustainable growth and maximise shareholder returns. The Axiata Board Investment Committee (ABIC) oversees all investment decisions, focusing on cash generation, return on investment and value creation. To further enhance financial resilience, managementled committees like the Capital Allocation Council (CAC) and the Merger & Acquisition Committee (MAC) provide strategic guidance, ensuring disciplined execution in a dynamic market.

**IAR,** Driving Governance & Risk on pages 84 to 93 and Transparency & Accountability on pages 95 to 129

### **Cyber Security and Building Digital Trust**

The Board Risk and Compliance Committee (BRCC) conducts continuous and comprehensive evaluations of the maturity and risk landscape pertaining to cyber security and data privacy, adhering strictly to the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERM). Strategic risk mitigation initiatives are aligned with industry best practices, ensuring optimal levels of protection and compliance.

Together, we are driving a transformative wave of research and innovation, significantly enhancing our cyber resilience through the Axiata Cyber Fusion Centre (ACFC). The recent introduction of our AI-powered threat attribution platform, HELIOS, stands as a testament to our commitment, earning accolades across the industry and the region.

We are also fortifying our strategic partnerships to strengthen the security of our 5G roll outs, pioneering the integration of cuttingedge technologies. Our strategic alliances with CyberSecurity Malaysia and the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) are essential in bolstering our threat intelligence and governance frameworks. These initiatives are our commitment to delivering secure services while fostering unwavering trust with our customers, regulators and all stakeholders.

**GAFS**, Building Digital Trust Through Data Privacy And Cyber Security on pages 29 to 32

### **Future Outlook and Appreciation**

Looking ahead to 2025, Axiata remains focused on strengthening its balance sheet, enhancing dividend capacity and advancing portfolio transformation to drive long-term sustainability and value creation. The Group will continue to refine its strategic direction to ensure financial resilience while seizing opportunities for growth in an evolving market landscape. As Asia's economic landscape evolves, Axiata is well-positioned for its next phase of growth, underpinned by a clear and disciplined strategy.

I would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Thayaparan S Sangarapillai who served previously as Independent Non-Executive Director, and Ong King How who served as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and representative of Khazanah Nasional Berhad, both of whom have resigned from the Board.

The Board is fully committed to guiding Axiata towards greater resilience, innovation and leadership. As part of its ongoing focus on governance excellence, the Group welcomes Amrit Kaur and Patrick Forth as Independent Non-Executive Directors and Dr Farid Mohamed Sani as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director to the Board. Their expertise and insights will be invaluable in shaping Axiata's future. The Board also extends its deepest appreciation to Dr Hans Wijayasuriya, whose leadership and contributions have been instrumental in Axiata's transformation. The Board wishes him continued success in his new role.

As the Group moves forward, its purpose of enabling digital connectivity, financial inclusion and sustainable progress remains central to its strategy, ensuring that Axiata upholds its commitment to creating lasting value for its stakeholders and the communities it serves.

"Axiata has made strong progress in its transformation, gaining valuable insights along the way. In 2023, to reinforce our long-term resilience, we took bold steps to strengthen our financial foundation, streamline operations, rebalance our portfolio, and accelerate digital transformation.

**Vivek Sood,** *Axiata's Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director outlines the Group's progress in delivering value to stakeholders while reinforcing its commitment to long-term sustainability and growth.*

Guided by our 5\*5 Strategy, we continued to drive market consolidation and create value for shareholders in 2024, while successfully navigating market volatility, currency fluctuations and regulatory shifts during the year.

Our goal has been clear — build future-ready businesses, strengthen our competitive edge in Southeast and South Asia, and simplify our investor proposition to deliver consistent returns.

The results are showing, as evident in our 2024 financial and operational performance. Synergies are taking shape, operational efficiencies are improving and our disciplined execution is delivering value. We have reinforced our market leadership in Malaysia, Cambodia and Sri Lanka while holding a strong second-place position in Bangladesh. In Indonesia, the upcoming XL Axiata and Smartfren merger will position the new entity, XLSMART, as a close number two player.

As we evolve into a Converged Connectivity Group, we remain focused on creating long-term, sustainable value. With a strong track record and disciplined execution, we are well-positioned to seize opportunities and deliver growing, sustainable returns to our shareholders."

### **How did Axiata's financial performance in 2024 reflect the Group's strategic priorities? Q1**

Axiata's 2024 financial performance underlined the success of our strategy, and disciplined capital and operational management, which reinforced our resilience across markets. Revenue1 grew by 1.9% on underlying basis, slightly below our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) target, but Earnings Before Interest and Taxes1 & 2 (EBIT) surged 39.3%, exceeding our

target of growth in the teens. Profit more than

doubled to RM947 million. At the OpCo level, XL, Robi, Smart and EDOTCO delivered record profits despite market challenges.

### **Q2 What were the impactful milestones achieved in 2024 under Axiata's 5\*5 Strategy, and how have these advancements strengthened the Group's position?**

In 2024, we focused on strengthening Axiata's foundation by enhancing operational efficiency and financial resilience. Key priorities included repositioning our OpCos for success, driving operational excellence, improving the balance sheet, reducing forex exposure and maintaining strong cash flows.

We accelerated momentum by capturing synergies. In Sri Lanka, we completed the Dialog-Airtel merger and fast-tracked the integration process, while in Indonesia, we signed a definitive agreement to merge XL and Smartfren and finalised the Link Net carve-out to establish a FibreCo, strengthening our infrastructure capabilities there. In Malaysia, we launched a digital bank, Boost Bank Berhad, partnering with RHB Banking Group.

### **Debt Reduction Efforts**

### **Improved HoldCo debt**

- HoldCo borrowings reduced from
- RM11.1 billion to RM9.5 billion

### **Strengthened Group financial position**

- Borrowings reduced from RM24.8 billion to RM23.2 billion
- Lowered USD-denominated debt from USD3.2 billion to USD2.8 billion

## **How does Axiata plan to sustain this trajectory to be a Sustainable Dividend**

Axiata is firmly committed to delivering sustainable dividends. We aim to achieve this by strategically balancing debt reduction with long-term value creation. Our approach centers on three key pillars: disciplined capital management, strategic portfolio optimisation and operational excellence.

By the end of 2026, we aim to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x. This target will strengthen our financial resilience, enabling us to deliver progressive dividend growth and a high single-digit total shareholder return. We will achieve this through consistent cash flow from our market-leading operating companies, strategic portfolio restructuring and maximising value from the sale of nonstrategic assets. In Indonesia, the proposed XL-Smartfren merger and Link Net's shift to a fibre wholesale model demonstrate our capital-efficient strategy.

Axiata's governance structure is aligned with our new operating model, ensuring strategic capital allocation and maintaining a robust balance sheet. Formalised policies, such as the Data/AI Governance Policy, and clear oversight across all operating companies ensure effective execution of our growth and sustainability objectives.

This structured approach, with a focus on efficient capital management across four key pillars, supports our goal of being a Sustainable Dividend Company. By reinforcing governance and financial discipline, Axiata is well-positioned to deliver consistent returns and solidify our leadership as a highperforming, future-ready connectivity provider.

### **Company? Q3 What are Axiata's key priorities for 2025 and how will this enable the Group to enhance its value proposition for shareholders? Q4**

In 2025, Axiata's key priority will be on maximising long-term shareholder value. We are refining our portfolio to focus on our core strengths: connectivity and convergence, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia, while maintaining our leadership positions in our frontier markets through strong capital management and operational excellence.

We are optimising our portfolio to maximise value. This includes prioritising long-term strategic assets by driving operational excellence, boosting profitability and increasing dividend generation. We will also pursue strategic monetisation of infrastructure assets in the near to medium term, and digital assets in the longer term, to generate additional financial opportunities.

The market consolidation in Indonesia with the upcoming XL Axiata-Smartfren merger in Indonesia is a critical step, creating significant scale and synergy. It allows us to capitalise on Indonesia's vast fixed broadband potential, a key growth area. We are also focused on maintaining strong market positions with at least 25% market share in all our key markets.

Meanwhile, plans are in place to illuminate value and monetise our infrastructure and digital assets to simplify our portfolio and bolster our financial strength. Proceeds from these actions, including the XL-Smartfren merger and infrastructure divestments, will be used to reduce HoldCo debt, significantly lowering costs and interest expenses.

These priorities look set to directly enhance shareholder returns by improving Axiata's profitability and dividend capacity, create a more streamlined and focused portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and reduce financial risk, and position Axiata for sustainable long-term growth in our key markets.

**Axiata Group Berhad** • **IAR 2024** 11

### **Q6 How is the Group driving sustainability and corporate responsibility to build long-term value?**

We firmly believe that our long-term success is inseparable from our commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. We continue to actively integrate ESG into our core business strategy, building on past progress to drive digital inclusion, ensure equitable technology access and embed robust climate action and governance practices.

Our Winning Culture, characterised by innovation, agility and collaboration, is a critical enabler of our sustainability efforts. It ensures ESG remains a central focus across the entire organisation.

To strengthen our governance and accountability, Axiata has implemented key measures. Starting in FY2025, OpCo CEOs will be evaluated based on ESG metrics tied to 'Business Ethics & Governance' and 'Digital Integrity'. This ensures direct accountability and aligns with our material sustainability priorities. The Axiata BSC provides oversight on this at the Group level. The use of the annual scorecard to track and ensure progress on key sustainability metrics aligns with the company's strategic priorities as it focuses on sustainability matters that are material to our business, ensuring that we meet our sustainability targets.

In addition to the annual scorecard, we have a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) structure for senior leadership that directly ties executive compensation to achieving key sustainability goals. The LTI programme is designed to drive tangible outcomes such as emissions intensity reduction and greater workforce diversity. This aligns executive performance with our long-term sustainability objectives.

These governance enhancements demonstrate our commitment to not just setting sustainability goals but also delivering measurable results. By holding ourselves accountable, we create lasting value for our shareholders, stakeholders and the communities we serve.

### **Bridging the Digital Divide**

~ 19 million lives through technologydriven solutions (as of 2024, this cumulative number is estimated to reach 29 million)

• Target: Reach 23 million people between 2022 and 2025

**IAR,** Advancing Digital Societies on pages 48 to 63

### **Championing People & Communities**

• Committed to fostering inclusivity and diversity in the workplace

**IAR,** Advancing Our People and Communities on pages 74 to 83

**IAR,** Driving Governance and Risk on pages 84 to 93

### **How is Axiata preparing to navigate emerging challenges, mitigate risks and capitalise on opportunities? Q7**

Axiata is proactively addressing emerging challenges by focusing on strategic consolidation, operational excellence and prudent financial management.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, we are navigating heightened competition through continuous innovation and accelerated merger synergies. The upcoming XL Axiata-Smartfren merger, once completed, will solidify a sustainable three-player market structure, unlocking significant network efficiencies and market competitiveness. This will drive stronger growth in Indonesia.

Beyond these key markets, we maintain market leadership in Cambodia and Sri Lanka, and maintain a strong second position in Bangladesh. Synergies from the Dialog-Airtel merger in Sri Lanka and CelcomDigi in Malaysia are already enhancing operational performance and market share.

We recognise the need for ongoing focus on cost efficiency and market differentiation in the increasingly competitive digital telco landscape. Additionally, we are strategically executing the 5G wholesale network development in Malaysia to ensure long-term value creation.

We are also actively managing macroeconomic risks, particularly in our frontier markets, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. While political and economic conditions pose challenges, stabilising currencies and market optimisation offer opportunities for long-term growth.

Guided by our 5\*5 Strategy, we are prioritising operational excellence, strategic cash management and selective growth investments. Our recent financial turnaround and structural improvements have strengthened our foundation, enabling us to deliver sustainable business growth and profitability. Through ongoing cost optimisation, debt reduction and asset monetisation, we are progressing towards our goal of becoming a Sustainable Dividend Company.

### **Closing Thoughts and Appreciation**

Axiata remains focused on sustainable growth, market leadership and long-term value creation in an industry that is rapidly evolving and remains competitive. With a clear, future-focused strategy, we are driving innovation, expanding digital inclusion and enhancing shareholder value across our markets. As we advance toward becoming a leading Converged Connectivity Group, we are well-positioned to capitalise on emerging opportunities and shape the industry's future.

## CONSIDERING WHAT MATTERS

### **Materiality Assessment**

Axiata conducts an internal review of its material matters on an annual basis, which is endorsed by the Board, to ensure ongoing relevance to society, the environment, business growth and stakeholders. We aim to conduct a double materiality assessment in 2025 to assess the financial impact of climate risks on Axiata and our broader environmental and social impact. This will enhance alignment with IFRS S1 & S2 and other evolving standards.

These annual internal reviews are crucial to our business sustainability and allow us to identify opportunities and mitigate risks associated with each material matter. They also serve as a strategic compass to guide our Board, leadership and the entire organisation in understanding and addressing the issues that impact us and our stakeholders. By aligning our business goals and strategies with the material matters and stakeholder needs and expectations, the leadership team can make informed decisions that foster sustainable development.

Looking ahead to 2025, we are working towards integrating top material matters into the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of our OpCo CEOs, embedding these priorities across all levels to ensure that everyone is aligned with and accountable for our material matters.

The Board Sustainability Committee's (BSC) approval is premised on the basis that there were no major external factors that necessitated a material change to our identified material matters, nor were there any significant changes to our business model or operating context that warranted a change in the identified material matters, throughout the reporting year.

### **TRADE-OFFS**

Reshaping our portfolio through the Dialog-Airtel merger, upcoming XL-Smartfren merger and Link Net's carve-out in 2024 reflects Axiata's strategic focus on enhancing operational synergies and economies of scale. These corporate exercises are expected to strengthen our Manufactured, Intellectual and Human Capitals, driving long-term efficiencies and innovation.

As we advance towards a Telco-TechCo, we are making significant infrastructure enhancements, including the integration of AI, analytics and digital platforms into our operations. Investment in talent development is key to equipping our workforce with the capabilities needed to drive this transformation. These initiatives directly strengthen our Manufactured, Intellectual and Human Capitals, but also place short-term pressure on Financial Capital due to the investment required. However, they are essential for long-term value creation, innovation and competitiveness.

Building a Winning Culture at the workplace is essential to supporting Axiata's growth, requiring investments in training and development, health and wellbeing programmes. These initiatives strengthen our Human Capital by fostering a thriving work environment that prioritises diversity, equity and inclusion, career progression and overall wellbeing. While these efforts require Financial Capital, they ensure we have the right talent in place to drive long-term growth and execute our strategies effectively.

In fostering digital and financial inclusion, investments in infrastructure and greater digital access such as EDOTCO's expansion and Boost Bank Berhad's steady progress directly contribute to Intellectual, Manufactured and Social & Relationship Capitals, as do digital services enhancements, including cyber security and information security initiatives. While they impact Financial Capital in the short term, these efforts are necessary to enable digitally safe and connected societies, which contributes to socio-economic development. We will exercise careful resource allocation to support sustainable value creation.

Our stakeholder engagement activities foster Social & Relationship Capital but they can limit investments in other capitals such as Intellectual, Manufactured and Natural capitals. However, Axiata believes that strong stakeholder relationships through consistent engagement and open dialogue builds long-term trust, which outweighs the short-term pressure on financial resources.

We are committed to our long-term climate goals and are proactively implementing measures to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Investments in green technologies and low-carbon solutions such as the deployment of solar power at our base stations impact Financial Capital but will strengthen Natural Capital and deliver positive, long-term environmental outcomes.

## 5 VECTORS OF VALUE CREATION

Axiata's 5 Vectors of Value Creation power the strategic execution of the Axiata 5\*5 Strategy. These vectors optimise synergies, enhance market positioning and unlock new opportunities across its core businesses, digital ventures and infrastructure assets.

By leveraging innovation, structural efficiencies and market consolidation, Axiata strengthens its competitive edge while navigating evolving industry landscapes. Focused on financial discipline and value realisation, the strategy positions Axiata as a leading Converged Connectivity Group committed to delivering sustainable dividends and long-term value creation.

## NEW ENGAGEMENT & OPERATING MODEL

Axiata's new engagement and operating model is designed for operational excellence. By empowering OpCo Boards to drive key decisions while maintaining strategic alignment and robust governance at the Group level, we foster agility and accountability. This, coupled with optimised capital allocation, enhanced risk oversight, and streamlined decision-making, ensures greater efficiency, improved returns, and sustainable long-term value for all stakeholders.

**Vivek Sood** *Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director*

Axiata is driving transformative operational excellence through its new engagement and operating model. We have significantly strengthened governance, optimised capital allocation and enhanced our strategic influence over subsidiaries and our joint-control entity. This model, with the Axiata Corporate Centre (ACC) as a proactive portfolio manager and capital allocator, empowers OpCo Boards to make decisive moves within clear guardrails, maximising efficiency and performance. The resulting leaner HoldCo structure delivers tangible improvements in returns, a testament to our commitment to operational excellence.

### **Evolving the Operating Model for Stronger OpCo Performance Management**

To maintain strong strategic control and oversight while fostering OpCo agility, Axiata has streamlined Group-OpCo engagements, transitioned to Board-led processes and strengthened risk governance. These changes empower OpCos to operate autonomously and adapt rapidly to market shifts.

### **DIGITAL INCLUSION**

### **Why Is This Important**

As the digital landscape expands, many individuals remain excluded due to barriers in access, affordability, and digital readiness. Operating in Southeast and South Asia emerging markets, we are committed to bridging this digital divide by enhancing connectivity, the foundation of digital inclusion, and empowering communities with the tools to participate in the digital economy. As AI continues to transform industries, ensuring inclusive digital access, especially for underserved and marginalised communities, is key to unlocking economic opportunities and building a more equitable and connected future for all.

### **Our Approach**

Through collaboration with governments, partners, and stakeholders, we enable individuals to participate in the digital economy. Our approach is anchored on four key pillars: expanding inclusive access, equipping communities with digital skills, fostering innovation for social impact, and ensuring the safe and responsible use of technology, as outlined in the table below.

**Target Segments:** Segments targeted include Lower Income Groups, Women and Girls, Seniors Individuals, Rural Communities, Individuals with Disabilities and Individuals with Lower Levels of Education.

### **Moving Forward**

The outlook for improving digital accessibility and inclusion amid AI advancements is promising but demands sustained effort. By 2025, increased investments in digital infrastructure will focus on expanding broadband connectivity and mobile networks, particularly in underserved and rural areas, enabling broader access to AI-driven services. AI's potential to enhance productivity, automate tasks, and improve decision-making will drive growth in key sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and finance. However, access to these technologies remains a challenge, making workforce upskilling and reskilling critical to ensuring AI benefits all, including marginalised communities. Ethical AI development, grounded in fairness, accountability, and transparency, will be essential in shaping inclusive and responsible AI adoption.

### **Our Progress**

### **Digital Inclusion Benchmark**

The Digital Inclusion Benchmark (DIB), conducted by the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA), evaluates the top 200 technology and communications companies worldwide on their role in fostering a more inclusive digital ecosystem and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2023, we maintained our position in the top quartile for the fourth consecutive year, ranking 22nd out of

![](_page_56_Picture_19.jpeg)

200 companies—a reflection of our sustained commitment to digital accessibility and inclusion.

In 2024, the WBA paused the DIB assessment to refine its methodology, with evaluations set to resume in 2025. Going forward, companies will be assessed biennially across six key areas: access, skills, use, innovation, sustainable value creation, and social impact. As we move ahead, we remain committed to strengthening our digital inclusion efforts and driving meaningful impact in the communities we serve.

### **EDISON Alliance**

Through the EDISON Alliance's 1 Billion Lives Challenge, we are committed to improving 23 million lives across Asia between 2022 and 2025, focusing on healthcare, education, and financial inclusion, including digital skills. Our initiatives, implemented through XL, Dialog, Smart, Robi, and Boost, have made a tangible impact, reaching nearly 26.8 million people as of the end of 2024.

### **CLIMATE CHANGE**

### **Why Is This Important**

Integrating climate action into our broader sustainability agenda is essential in response to clear climate science and the urgent call for action. Setting clear climate targets strengthens operational resilience, drives innovation, enhances market leadership, and improves long-term efficiency. These efforts are critical to align with sustainability goals and reinforcing our commitment to responsible and future-ready growth.

### **Our Approach**

Our approach to climate action is driven by clear targets aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C. We commit to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring our long-term resilience and responsibility to future generations. This commitment shapes our Net-Zero Carbon Roadmap, guiding our strategy to reduce emissions across our operations. To strengthen our approach, we adopt the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, enhancing our ability to assess climate risks, integrate sustainability into decision-making, and drive meaningful progress.

### **Moving Forward**

Axiata has made significant progress, receiving SBTi approval for our near-term as well as long-term targets based on a 2022 baseline, and is the first telecommunications company in Malaysia to have achieved this. We remain optimistic about new technologies, regulatory shifts, and national-level actions accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. By forging transformative partnerships and prioritising investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, we are dedicated to navigating evolving regulations and climate policies to effectively mitigate climate impacts and drive the shift to a sustainable future.

### **Our Progress**

### **Advancing Net-Zero Carbon Pathway**

Axiata's Net-Zero Carbon Roadmap outlines three strategic objectives to drive collective action and pave the Group's path towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions by no later than 2050:

### **Decarbonise Network Operations**

Near-term target to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 42% by 2030 and 90% by 2050 from a 2022 base year.

### **Transform Our Value Chain**

Long-term target to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 and 90% by 2050 from a 2022 base year.

### **Deliver An Inclusive Climate Agenda**

Contribute to positive climate action through carbon removal and by enabling avoidance through technology and digitisation.

### **SBTi Approves Axiata Group's Science-based Targets**

As one of Asia's largest telecommunications groups with more than 1751 million users across eight countries, Axiata is taking responsibility for its direct and indirect emissions. Committed to climate action, the Group has set credible reduction targets and aligned them with the SBTi to establish a clear pathway towards a 1.5°C-aligned climate plan.

In June 2024, Axiata received approval from the SBTi for its near-term and net-zero targets based on a 2022 baseline. Axiata is the first telecommunications company in Malaysia to have its carbon reduction targets approved by the SBTi. These targets include reducing absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 42% by 2030 and 90% by 2050, as well as reducing absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 and 90% by 2050. With this endorsement, Axiata confirms that its decarbonisation pathway is scientifically aligned.

*Note: <sup>1</sup> Includes digital telcos and digital businesses in footprint countries*

### **Our Progress (cont'd)**

### **Strengthening Our Net-Zero Efforts**

We continue to advance on our net-zero carbon pathway with SBTi-approved targets, integrating climate action across our operations to reduce emissions as well as emissions intensity and ensure long-term sustainability.

### **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**

We are committed to strengthening our climate-related disclosures by aligning with Axiata's TCFD three-year roadmap (2022–2024) and progressively closing any gaps. Recognising that TCFD recommendations are now integrated into the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures issued by the ISSB, we ensure our reporting remains consistent with its 4 core pillars and 11 recommended disclosures. Since embarking on our TCFD journey, we have continuously refined our data, methodologies, and climate practices. As we advance, we will update and enhance our approach to align with the latest reporting standards and frameworks.

### **Governance**

The Axiata Board holds ultimate responsibility for the Group's sustainability agenda, with the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) overseeing climate-related matters and ensuring ESG integration into corporate strategy. Regular updates, including periodic BSC sessions as well as quarterly sustainability steering committee sessions, strengthen the board's oversight.

At the management level, the Group CEO and SLTs are accountable for sustainability-related KPIs, including climate change measures, which are linked to our net-zero commitment. Sustainability performance, with net-zero commitments, is integrated into remuneration-linked KPIs.

The Axiata Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by the Group CEO & MD, ensures ESG collaboration and alignment across the Group, while OpCo CEOs and Boards integrate sustainability into decision-making and governance.

### **Our Progress (cont'd)**

### **Strategy**

Sustainability is embedded in our corporate strategy, and we are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Recognising the connection between climate change and social inequality, we leverage our Telco-to-TechCo journey to drive both climate action and economic growth across the markets we serve.

We have strengthened our climate agenda through our SBTi-approved science-based targets and the implementation of our Net-Zero Carbon Roadmap. Our strategy remains aligned with TCFD recommendations, ensuring that climate risk assessments, scenario analysis, and decarbonisation efforts are integrated into business resilience and long-term value creation. As sustainability reporting standards evolve, we continue monitoring IFRS S1 & S2 implementation to ensure our practices remain aligned with future requirements.

### **Risk Management**

We strengthen our climate risk management by identifying, assessing, and integrating climaterelated risks and opportunities into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework. This approach enhances business resilience and decision-making by embedding climate considerations into strategic planning.

In the future, we plan to further integrate climate-related risks into relevant planning and/or decision-making processes to align with the evolving disclosure requirements of IFRS S1 and S2, which will apply from 2025. This will enhance transparency, support risk-informed decision and strengthen our climate resilience strategy.

### Risk Assessment

We conduct ongoing climate risk assessments to anticipate potential impacts, support informed decision-making, and strengthen long-term sustainability efforts.

### **Systematic Climate Risk Assessments**

Conducted evaluation on physical and transition risks to ensure alignment with evolving regulatory and market expectations.

### **Expansion of Risk Monitoring**

Implemented monitoring mechanisms to track climate-related risks across all OpCos, with regular reviews conducted by the BRCC.

### **Integration into ERM Framework**

Embedded climate risks into policies, procedures, risk appetite, tolerance, and mitigation strategies to strengthen oversight and response measures.

### **Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Matrix Implementation**

Leveraged the CMMI matrix to measure and monitor our ability to mitigate climate-related risks.

### Climate-Related Risks

We continuously evaluate transition and physical climate-related risks to stay ahead of emerging challenges in 2024.

We will continue refining our climate risk & opportunity framework by incorporating insights from IFRS S2 climaterelated disclosures, strengthening data-driven scenario analysis, and improving risk mitigation strategies. As we prepare the 2025 update, we will assess new developments, emerging risks and evolving business impacts to ensure a comprehensive and future-ready approach.

### **Priorities for 2025**

- We are currently evaluating the financial implications of key climate risks and opportunities
- We will initiate the process of assessing and integrating IFRS S1 and S2 requirements into our disclosures while keeping abreast of these sustainability standards. In line with the NSRF, we will also evaluate the alignment of our reporting with these evolving global standards

### **Metrics and Targets**

Our operations rely predominantly on non-renewable energy, which contributes to carbon emissions and climate change. To manage our carbon footprint, we prioritise energy consumption management through continuous monitoring, identifying emission sources and exploring reduction opportunities. By tracking data accurately, we enhance transparency, strengthen stakeholder trust and align with TCFD disclosure and risk management principles.

### Carbon Emissions Across the Group and Boundary Adjustments

We track and refine our carbon emissions data across Scope 1, 2 and 3 of which categories 6 & 7 have been reported as part of Bursa Common Indicators, ensuring accuracy amid evolving emission factors, operational changes and corporate exercises. In 2024, we adopted the latest IEA 2023 Emissions Factors, which were incorporated into our GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) assurance process by an external assurer. We will continue monitoring the impact of future updates, including the upcoming IEA 2024 factors, on our emissions reporting.

Our emissions boundary setting has also been updated to reflect the recent corporate exercises undertaken. This includes Dialog's acquisition of Airtel Lanka, and Link Net's transfer of fixed broadband customers to XL in 2024, which led to adjustments in ESG indicators. Additionally, we have included Reddot's emission data into the Robi Group emission boundary to improve data quality.

We revised our Scope 1 and 2 emissions baseline from 2020 to 2022, for setting SBTi targets using the most recent inventory. Our updated 2022 baseline totals 1,039,646.60 tCO₂e for both Scope 1 & 2. Please refer to SNCR 2023 for a detailed breakdown by OpCos. We also calculated our 2024 Scope 3 emissions for Category 6 (Business Travel) and Category 7 (Employee Commuting), reported in the Bursa Malaysia Performance Data section.

### **ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT**

### **Why Is This Important**

Effective environmental management ensures resource efficiency, risk mitigation, cost savings and regulatory compliance while supporting sustainable development goals. By minimising our environmental footprint, we create long-term value for stakeholders and contribute to a more sustainable future.

### **Our Approach**

We integrate environmental sustainability into our operations by minimising our environmental footprint and promoting responsible resource use. Our approach focuses on waste management, water conservation and biodiversity protection, while advancing towards a circular economy to enhance long-term sustainability.

### **Moving Forward**

Axiata will strengthen its environmental management efforts across its operations, with a comprehensive focus on waste, water and biodiversity management in 2025. We will enhance the monitoring, tracking and evaluation of our environmental performance, actively seeking innovative solutions to reduce our impact. By prioritising waste management and circularity, we aim to foster sustainable practices and contribute to the preservation of natural resources across our footprint.

### **Our Progress**

### **Waste Management**

Effective waste management is integral to Axiata's net-zero commitment, ensuring responsible resource use and landfill waste reduction across our operations. We prioritise waste reduction, recycling and e-waste management, while also collaborating with our suppliers to minimise waste generation across the procurement process.

In 2024, the Group began monitoring waste management-related metrics, marking its first year of structured data collection across its operations. While full 12-month coverage is not yet available, all OpCos have reported data for at least three months, with some beginning their tracking efforts in the last quarter of 2024.

Most OpCos reported on waste management, though reporting on waste diverted from disposal remains incomplete. To strengthen alignment and consistency in waste data reporting, the Group facilitated discussions through the Sustainability Steering Committee and Board Sustainability Committee meetings in 2024.

Moving forward, we will continue to enhance waste monitoring, tracking and evaluation, while driving innovative solutions to improve waste management and circularity across our operations.

![](_page_73_Figure_21.jpeg)

### **Water Management**

While Axiata operates in a low water-intensive industry, we recognise the importance of efficient water use in our workplaces. We began tracking water consumption in 2023, with data currently covering OpCo headquarters for Robi, Smart and EDOTCO, while Link Net reports water usage at network sites.

In 2024, we expanded water consumption reporting coverage. New scopes and boundaries now include all OpCos, excluding ADA, while Boost reports on its Malaysia office. We plan to expand reporting to include all OpCos and their subsidiaries in the future. Communication regarding water consumption reporting has been conducted through the Sustainability Steering Committee and the Board Sustainability Committee meetings during the year.

To optimise water utilisation and efficiency, we are committed to implementing strategic initiatives across the Group.

*Note: <sup>1</sup> The FY2023 value has been restated from 501.6 million litres to 350.8 million litres due to misreporting by one of the OpCos*

### **Biodiversity**

Our industry can support biodiversity conservation through digital solutions that enhance natural resource management and promote sustainability. Technology enables efficient resource use, conservation efforts and strategies to mitigate biodiversity loss, helping to protect ecosystems and reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities in at-risk communities.

## **OpCos Initiatives 2024 Progress**

## ADVANCING GREEN ECONOMY

### **Our Progress (cont'd)**

### **Strengthening Environmental Management Efforts Across Our OpCos**

In 2024, the Group introduced its Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Policy, reinforcing our commitment to environmental responsibility and a strong health and safety culture. Several OpCos, including Dialog and EDOTCO, have also adopted environmental policies, committing to compliance beyond regulatory requirements, net-zero targets and grievance mechanisms to address non-compliance. We will continue supporting other OpCos in developing policies tailored to their operations while embedding best practices across the Group.

### **What This Means to Us Material Matters Prioritised UN SDGs**

Our commitment to a Winning Culture is built on the belief that people drive progress, within our organisation, in the marketplace and across communities. We foster an inclusive and dynamic work environment where individuals can grow, contribute and innovate. Beyond the workplace, we harness technology to create meaningful impact through long-term initiatives in education, community development and environmental sustainability. By doing so, we strengthen the communities we serve and empower them for a better future.

**4 11 12 13 15**

### **FAIR, DIVERSE & INCLUSIVE EMPLOYMENT**

### **Why Is This Important**

Fairness, diversity, and inclusion are integral to our Winning Culture, shaping an environment where every individual feels valued and empowered. With a team of approximately 10,500, we believe equitable opportunities drive innovation, strengthen morale and inspire exceptional performance, ensuring our collective success.

### **Our Approach**

We are guided by our Winning Culture framework, where Passion for Collaboration drives us to embrace diversity and learn from each other. Our approach is anchored in established policies that govern recruitment, benefits and performance management, ensuring alignment with evolving industry standards.

### **Moving Forward**

We will continue strengthening our commitment to fairness, diversity and inclusion by enhancing awareness programmes, and fostering a more inclusive workplace culture. We will track progress through employee feedback and industry benchmarks, ensuring that our initiatives drive meaningful impact and long-term sustainability.

### **EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY & WELLBEING**

### **Why Is This Important**

Axiata prioritises employee health, safety and wellbeing to ensure a secure and supportive work environment. As our people are central to operations, we implement comprehensive safety measures, protocols and wellbeing initiatives to protect them from hazards and promote overall wellness.

### **Our Approach**

We comply with all local and international regulations. Our Axiata Group Berhad Safety Policy guides OpCos in implementing and reviewing OHS policies, while Health and Safety Committees work to minimise risks. Employees benefit from initiatives that promote physical and mental wellbeing, work-life balance and workplace safety, supported by the Wellbeing Circle and New Ways of Working strategies for continuous improvement.

### **Moving Forward**

Axiata and its OpCos will continue to strengthen efforts to improve employee health, safety and wellbeing. We will continue to monitor key health and safety metrics to proactively address concerns. Our digital businesses will also expand OHS initiatives to embed a stronger safety culture across the Group.

### **Our Progress**

### **Fostering a Safe and Productive Workplace**

Axiata prioritises employee wellbeing through targeted health, safety, and wellness initiatives. We ensure a safe work environment by identifying and mitigating risks through Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) systems and regular assessments.

In 2024, the Group developed and approved its Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Policy, which is aligned with the Axiata Code of Conduct. Guided by this policy, we are committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner and fostering health and safety practices that prevent workrelated injuries and illnesses.

While most operations are in office and retail settings, EDOTCO faces higher risks, such as working at height and electrical work. To mitigate this, suppliers comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, and employees in high-risk roles undergo mandatory training and refresher courses. Digital systems help monitor risks, accidents and safety performance across OpCos.

### **EMERGENCY DISASTER & RESPONSE**

### **Why Is This Important**

Disasters pose significant risks to lives, economies and the environment, making connectivity and communication essential during crises. As a telecommunications and digital business, Axiata plays a critical role in providing information, coordination and support to affected communities. Through preparedness, early warnings and robust infrastructure, we help strengthen disaster response and community resilience.

### **Our Approach**

Axiata integrates ISO 22301 principles across OpCos through a robust Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework, ensuring service continuity during crises. As a GSMA Humanitarian Connectivity Charter signatory, we enhance disaster preparedness, resilience and coordination with governments and NGOs. Through Axiata Foundation's Jalinan Kasih Budi programme and OpCos' initiatives, we provide training for employees and volunteers to strengthen disaster response and humanitarian aid efforts, supporting vulnerable communities.

### **Moving Forward**

We are committed to ensuring uninterrupted service by maintaining reliable connections and providing essential information for effective disaster management. We place a strong emphasis on robust BCM strategies and actively strengthen ties with local disaster agencies, non-profits and government entities.

Axiata enhances disaster preparedness, response and recovery through risk identification, early warning systems, crisis management plans and regular training. By establishing clear roles, communication protocols and recovery strategies, we minimise disruptions and improve resilience across all OpCos, ensuring continuous readiness and adaptation.

### **DIGITAL INTEGRITY**

### **Why Is This Important**

The fast-paced evolution of technology, alongside rising cyber threats and tightening regulations, has placed digital trust under pressure. As customers grow more concerned about how their data is handled, especially in the telco and digital space, safeguarding privacy and security has become critical. Preserving this trust is essential for ensuring our long-term relevance and resilience.

### **Our Approach**

As a trusted digital partner, Axiata is committed to safeguarding the data entrusted to us by customers, employees and business partners. With rapid technological advancement and an evolving threat landscape, cyber security risks are becoming more complex, while data privacy remains a key concern for telco and digital customers. Our cyber security and data privacy strategies are anchored in strong governance, integrating preventive, detective and responsive controls. By fostering a culture of responsibility across our operations, we reinforce customer trust and ensure the long-term resilience of our business.

### **Moving Forward**

As we advance our data privacy and cyber security efforts, we remain focused on strengthening governance, enhancing resilience and aligning with global best practices. Our privacy maturity framework continues to evolve, ensuring compliance across all markets, while our cyber security strategy drives the adoption of Zero Trust Architecture and proactive threat detection. Innovation and collaboration remain central to our approach, as we work with governments, industry partners and universities to bolster security capabilities and develop future-ready talent.

### **Speaking Up**

Axiata's Code of Conduct reinforces the importance of speaking up against unlawful, unethical or non-compliant behaviour. To strengthen this culture, continuous training on whistleblowing was conducted for employees and vendors, ensuring awareness of reporting channels and protection measures.

Anyone connected to Axiata and its subsidiaries can report concerns, including anonymously, through the Axiata Group Speak-Up Channel (https://axiatagroup.integrityline.com), managed by an independent external provider and overseen by Axiata Group Internal Audit.

We uphold a strict no-retaliation policy to safeguard individuals reporting in good faith. All reports are thoroughly reviewed, with investigations conducted where necessary, and substantiated cases result in appropriate disciplinary action, including dismissal where warranted.

### **Anti-Competitive Behaviour**

Competition compliance is crucial to maintaining ethical business practices, which all stakeholders must adhere to. As outlined in the Axiata Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers and vendors are forbidden from engaging in anticompetitive behaviour.

The Employee Code of Conduct mandates all employees to comply with applicable competition laws and refrain from participating in any activities that may violate these laws.

In general, all Axiata's OpCos, where applicable, adhere to all domestic anti-competition laws, regulations or provisions contained in their respective operation licenses.

### **Risk Management**

Axiata employs a Risk Management framework aligned with ISO 31000:2018, overseen by key management teams throughout the organisation. OpCos adhere to a consistent set of policies and standards, which facilitates measurable risk management aligned with the defined Risk Appetite Statements, ensuring compliance with the organisation's objectives.

The tone set by senior leadership is reinforced through quarterly BRCC and the RCMC meetings, with risk management as a principal agenda item. This standardised approach is implemented across all OpCos and is overseen by the local Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) teams.

All identified risks undergo prompt review and mitigation at their source, or they are escalated to the Group Management Committees for necessary action and subsequent reporting. The ERM teams operate in a second-line defense capacity, engaging collaboratively with the first line to ensure effective risk assessment and mitigation processes are in place.

The Group Tax Department assesses aggregated tax risk based on information received from OpCos to determine and report on overall tax position for Axiata Group. The Audit Committee of the Board deliberates and approves Axiata's financial reporting, including the review of tax matters material to the financial statements. This role is also carried out by the respective OpCo Audit Committees of the OpCo Boards.

In addition, the Annual Report Management Committee oversees matters related to the IAR while the BSC oversees matters relating to the Sustainability section in the IAR.

### **Tax Reporting**

Axiata discloses its annual taxes and fee contributions by country and OpCo through the National Contribution Report, while tax payments are reflected in the Group Audited Financial Statements. In the year under review, Axiata contributed RM693 million (approximately USD155 million) of tax payments across all operating countries.

### **Engagement with Tax Authorities**

Axiata and its OpCos uphold strict ethical standards when engaging with tax authorities. We refrain from engaging in inaccurate or evasive practices. In cases of unclear tax laws, we seek professional tax advice. Additionally, we actively participate in tax consultations relevant to our business to ensure regulatory alignment and contribute to policy discussions.

**GAFS,** Audited Financial Statements on pages 44 to 204

protection of customers' rights on the Internet. We are committed to engaging with stakeholders, both internal and external, to identify, assess and address salient human rights issues specific to our operations and industry context.

### **Tax Transparency**

Axiata contributes both direct and indirect taxes, along with fees, to the economies, nationbuilding efforts and the socio-economic development of all the countries where we operate. Tax transparency is crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance, maintaining trust among stakeholders, investors and customers, mitigating legal and reputational risks and contributing to sustainable development.

### **Approach to Tax**

Axiata's tax approach is governed by the Axiata Group Policies – Taxation Chapter, ensuring compliance with tax laws, regulations and effective tax management across all OpCos. Decisionmaking thresholds are guided by the Group's and OpCos' Limit of Authorities.

### **Tax Governance, Control and Risk Management**

The key focus areas of tax governance are to ensure compliance with tax laws and mitigate risks. Therefore, effective tax governance involves establishing clear policies, procedures and oversight to manage tax-related activities. This includes assigning responsibilities to various personnel within Axiata to ensure accurate tax returns, timely tax payments and comprehensive tax reporting. All these measures ensure tax transparency, build trust with stakeholders and drive sustainability.

At Axiata, the Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for Group tax compliance matters. Additionally, the Group Tax Department monitors and coordinates on tax matters of Axiata and its OpCos. Similarly, OpCo CFOs are responsible for ensuring compliance with tax law and obligations within their respective OpCos. All OpCos have either designated personnels or a Taxation department to handle respective country's tax matters.

### **REGULATORY AND POLITICAL RISK**

### **Why Is This Important**

Regulatory and political changes directly impact Axiata's business viability, competitive edge and longterm growth. Proactively monitoring these shifts enables timely adjustments to management and business strategies, ensuring compliance and operational resilience. Effectively navigating these challenges allows Axiata to adapt to evolving policies, mitigate risks and seize opportunities, strengthening its position in dynamic markets.

### **Our Approach**

- Proactively shape the landscape (external environment) at each OpCo market, enabling proper and effective management of regulatory issues confronting the respective OpCos while ensuring fair and transparent practices of policies
- Uphold Axiata's corporate governance through Axiata Regulatory Compliance Framework
- Develop Group-wide positions on key issues and joint on-ground engagements with OpCos to drive strategic regulatory positions
- Drive thought leadership and active participations in consultations and industry association events, to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing for best industry policies and practices, including with relevant partners such as the ITU and GSMA
- Establish and operationalise Regulatory Expert Working Group for systematic sharing of best practices among OpCos
- Effective oversight and monitoring on major developments and identifications of key challenges; strategise and improve OpCos' agility to respond and adapt to regulatory changes

### **Moving Forward**

Axiata remains committed to navigating evolving regulatory and political landscapes by staying agile and responsive to policy changes across its markets. Key focus areas include:

- Securing timely and affordable spectrum releases for 4G and 5G services and identifying new spectrum bands for the future
- Conducting regular advocacy sessions at regional and national-level regulators' forums and thought leadership events to address issues such as spectrum, 5G licensing, taxation, digital competition, industry sustainability, open access, Network Fair Share and digital policy

### **Our Progress**

### **Regulatory and Political Risks in 2024**

In 2024, Axiata navigated key regulatory and political risks, including spectrum allocation changes in Malaysia and Bangladesh. Political instability in Bangladesh led to regulatory uncertainty, however, the interim government has initiated sectoral reforms to move towards a more efficient industry structure. In Sri Lanka, the regulatory authority enacted new competition rules to govern market competition in the telecom sector. Adapting to these challenges was essential for sustaining competitiveness and long-term growth.

We also monitored risks, including geopolitical tensions and cyber threats, AI-driven cybercrime, evolving regulations, supply chain security vulnerabilities, emerging technologies requiring faster threat detection and cyber skills gaps across sectors.

### **Performance in 2024**

- Strong government support The government of Malaysia, along with its overseas missions and embassies, provided significant backing. Notably, the YAB Prime Minister officiated the launch of Boost Bank Berhad in June 2024 and supported advocacy efforts related to tax issues in Bangladesh
- Effective engagement Axiata and its OpCos successfully engaged government policymakers and National Regulatory Authorities on key industry issues such as 5G policy in Cambodia and timing of future spectrum release in Indonesia
- Malaysia Secured the necessary Cyber Security Service licences from National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA)
- All markets Prioritised regulatory compliance and risk management, minimising incidences of non-compliance
- Robi acquired an additional 20 MHz of spectrum in the 2.6 GHz band, and in line with industry expectations, the regulatory authority adopted the local currency for spectrum pricing

- Mitigated more punitive regulatory action in several markets including Cambodia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
- Industry collaboration Coordinated advocacy efforts with GSMA and industry associations on spectrum policy, taxation and regulatory costs
- Collaboration with Malaysian government agencies MoUs on cyber security cooperation signed with MDeC and CyberSecurity Malaysia
- Regulatory Experts Working Group Brought together regulatory and policy practitioners from OpCos and the Corporate Centre to discuss key topics, including online safety, cyber security, sustainable spectrum costs, spectrum auction game theory, 5G developments, AI policy and network fair contribution

### **Our Progress (cont'd)**

### **Stakeholder Engagement**

Axiata remains committed to proactive engagement with regulators, policymakers and industry players to address compliance challenges and explore strategic opportunities. The Group continues to foster collaborative discussion through engagements with:

- National governments and regulatory authorities to align on industry policies
- Regional and global industry associations to advocate for fair and sustainable regulatory frameworks
- Business and development organisations to support infrastructure growth and digital inclusion.
- Vendors, public policy institutes and the general public to ensure transparent, responsible and consumer-focused operations

### **SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN**

### **Why Is This Important**

Axiata's success and growth rely on a sustainable supply chain across our OpCos with suppliers supporting our digital and mobile services. Ensuring service quality, innovation and responsible business practices, we expect suppliers to uphold high ethical standards and integrate EESG considerations. Strengthening sustainability in our supply chain creates positive community impact, enhances supplier resilience and meets stakeholder expectations.

### **Our Progress**

### **Supplier Screening**

Supplier screening is conducted during onboarding process. Potential suppliers are required to provide relevant information together with supporting documents, and these submissions will undergo a detailed due diligence review.

### **Supplier Assessment**

Evaluating suppliers is essential to ensuring alignment with Axiata's standards, minimising risks and improving supply chain performance. Assessments cover financial stability, operational capabilities, regulatory compliance and quality standards to prevent disruptions. At the Corporate Centre, for instance, ESG criterias are integrated into supplier evaluations, covering environmental impact, safety, carbon emissions and social responsibility. Regular assessments also optimise costs, enhance efficiency and strengthen supplier collaboration for improved business outcomes.

### **Grievance Mechanism**

Axiata provides suppliers with a Speak-Up channel to report Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC) violations, unethical behaviour or wrongdoing. Our Whistleblowing Policy ensures reports can be submitted without fear of reprisal, with strong protections for whistleblowers and investigators acting in good faith.

### **Supporting Local Suppliers**

Axiata prioritises local suppliers to strengthen economy, diversify procurement and enhance supply chain resilience. We monitor local supplier participation and spending across OpCos, adapting to country-specific definitions and regulations. Supporting local suppliers also drives job creation and socio-economic growth in our operating markets.

### **Our Approach**

Axiata's diverse supply chain spans across equipment vendors, infrastructure providers and IT service partners, all essential to delivering seamless operations and meeting customer needs. We actively collaborate with our suppliers to build strong, lasting relationships, ensuring supply chain resilience, particularly in challenging times. Our commitment is to maintain uninterrupted operations while supporting our suppliers in meeting evolving business and sustainability expectations. Axiata requires all suppliers to uphold the highest ethical standards, as outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC).

### **Moving Forward**

security and privacy practices

Supply chain disruptions pose risks to Axiata's core business and operations. To mitigate these challenges, we partner with established suppliers to leverage their scale and enhance supply chain resilience. Our strategy includes collaborating with top regional suppliers and diversifying sourcing locations across stable Asian markets to minimise exposure to geopolitical risks and ensure business continuity.

## **BRIDGING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE**

Strong governance and ethical practices are the foundation of Axiata's commitment to responsible and sustainable business conduct.

## **TRANSPARENCY & ACCOUNTABILITY**

## COMMITTED TO ACCOUNTABILITY

### **The Board of Directors of Axiata Group Berhad (Board or BOD) strongly advocate and support the principles of good corporate governance. The Board has continually strived to enhance and strengthen the Group's governance system and processes to ensure that the highest level of corporate governance is practised Group-wide.**

This Corporate Governance Overview Statement (CG Overview Statement) presents key governance highlights for the financial year 2024 and up to the date of publication of this Integrated Annual Report (IAR) 2024, outlining how Axiata complies with the principles and practices of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 (MCCG 2021) during the year under review.

This statement has been made in accordance with the authority of the Board dated 26 March 2025 and finalised and updated until the date of the publication of this IAR with delegated authority to the Annual Report Management Committee (ARMC), a management committee established in 2024 with its primary obligation to oversee the preparation and finalisation of the annual report of Axiata.

This statement is complemented with a Corporate Governance Report (CG Report) based on a prescribed format pursuant to paragraph 15.25 of the Main Market Listing Requirements (Main LR) of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa Securities). The CG Report is available on the Company's website under the Corporate Governance section as well as via an announcement on Bursa Securities. This statement should also be read in conjunction with the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC) and the Board Audit Committee (BAC) Report as well as other information in the Governance and Audited Financial Statements 2024 (GAFS) and the Sustainability Report as set out in the IAR.

Throughout the Financial Year Ended 31 December 2024 and continuing until the date of this IAR 2024, the Company has complied with the provisions of the MCCG 2021 save for the following :-

- a) Practice 5.2, which is the requirement that the Board of large companies should comprise a majority of independent directors;
- b) Practices 8.2 and 8.3 (Step Up) relating to disclosure of senior management remuneration; and
- c) Practice 9.4 which is the Step Up on the requirement to have all Independent Non-Executive Directors on the Board Audit Committee.

A more thorough description of the manner in which the Company is addressing these departures is set out in the CG Report.

The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of good governance to promote quality decision making and the execution of those decisions within a disciplined framework of policies and procedures.

Good governance exists in an environment where roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, forums are conducive for a robust debate and performance is regularly reviewed. We outline our progress and describe our governance efforts over the next few pages. The Board provides effective leadership to the Group and embraces the principles of ethical leadership in setting and implementing the Group's strategy.

To ensure we make and execute good decisions and direction in the interest of the Group, its shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board works continuously to maintain and develop its governance framework. The Board exercises independent judgement on all issues reserved for the Board's review and approval, while simultaneously considering the needs of all stakeholders, and take full responsibility for the management, direction and performance of the Group.

### **HOW OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTE TO VALUE CREATION**

Good corporate governance contributes to value creation by ensuring accountability through reporting and disclosure, effective risk management, clear performance management, transparency and ethical and effective leadership. In addition, the diversity of our directors in terms of gender, race, nationality and professional background (refer pages 97 and 114) facilitates an environment for constructive dialogue and enables the Board to consider the needs of a wide range of stakeholder matters of importance and interests.

The Board believes these qualities of governance, which are aligned with the principles and practices of the MCCG 2021, enable the Group to create value for stakeholders in a sustainable manner over the short, medium and long term as described in the strategy section of this IAR.

### **CHANGES IN OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK**

In efforts to refine attention on investment activities within the Group, the Board had expanded the scope of the previously named Axiata Enterprise Investment Board Committee (AEIB) to encompass a broader range of investment activities. The AEIB was renamed as the Axiata Board Investment Committee (ABIC) effective 9 November 2023 and further mandated in line with the committee's broader scope. At the same time, similar committees have been rolled out at PT XL Axiata Tbk, PT Link Net Tbk, Robi Axiata PLC, Dialog Axiata PLC and Smart Axiata Co., Ltd. emulating at the OpCos the same function as ABIC. The duties and responsibilities of ABIC are to evaluate, discuss, and recommend to the Board proposals pertaining to budget allocations, returns expectations and/or funding requirements in line with the scope outlined in its Terms Of Reference and in accordance to the approval limits set out in the Limits of Approval (LoA) Policy and/or the Financial Policies & Procedures of the Company.

Since the inaugural issue of our annual report in an integrated manner in the IAR 2017 issued in 2018, matters relating to Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) remain a core focus of Axiata and command significant attention. In keeping with the growing importance of ESG, we welcome the introduction of various ESG recommended practices in MCCG 2021 as well as the Listing Requirements. In keeping with these new provisions we introduced key performance indicators (KPIs) on ESG matters for the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) and OpCo CEOs. To ensure that it commands the attention that this important segment merits, the ESG functions in Axiata has been placed within the direct reporting line to the GCEO with twice-yearly tabling at Board meetings.

In line with the recommendation from the Board Effectiveness Evaluation Exercise 2023 the scope of the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) has been streamlined to only focus on matters of sustainability and that the responsibilities on annual reporting has been shifted to the ARMC which is charged and mandated to oversee, guide and manage the preparation of the Annual Report. This change ensures that proper focus and attention may be placed on matters of sustainability and Annual Reports by segmenting each into dedicated committees with clear focus, roles and responsibilities.

Following the introduction of a Fit & Proper Policy for Axiata (F&P Policy) in July 2022 that require assessments of fitness and probity of individuals nominated as directors and senior management of the Group before their appointment and employment as the case may be, the BNRC has monitored the implementation of the F&P Policy. The F&P Policy meets and exceeds the provisions of the Listing Requirements in its scope of application. Since its implementation, all appointments to the Axiata Board have had an assessment of fitness and probity conducted prior to the appointments and the policy has also been applied on the re-election of directors who are standing for re-election following mandatory rotational retirement as well as from appointments during the year.

Bursa Securities issued amendments to the Listing Requirements in the middle of 2023 which amongst others expanded the scope and remit of Audit Committees to review conflict of interest (COI) situations that arise or persist, and the measures taken to resolve, eliminate, or mitigate the COI. The said amendments also require the disclosure in the BAC Report of a summary of the COI reviewed and the measures taken to resolve, eliminate, or mitigate such conflicts.

Following the introduction of these amendments, the Board Audit Committee had, in November 2023, constructed and adopted a COI Reporting Framework to identify and report on COIs that arises within the Axiata Group. The reports arising from the same will assist in the preparation of the BAC Report that will identify measures on the resolution, elimination, or mitigation of such COIs. The COI Declarations made by the Directors and employees of Axiata Group are tabled at periodical BAC meetings throughout the year and the inaugural COI reporting is disclosed in the BAC Report on pages 26 to 28 of the GAFS.

### **OUR GOVERNANCE PRACTICES**

### **Leadership**

### **Non-Executive Directors Meeting**

In 2024, Axiata Board had four Non-Executive Directors (NED) Meetings without the presence of the Executive Directors and management and discussed wide ranging issues relating to the operations and business of the Group.

### *Notes:*

*\* In August 2024, the function and role of the BSC was streamlined to only focus on matters of sustainability and the responsibilities on annual reporting was shifted to the Annual Report Management Committee*

![](_page_114_Figure_18.jpeg)

There is a clear and transparent process for the selection, nomination and appointment of suitable candidates to the Board of Axiata, the key objective of which is to achieve board balance through diversity in skill set, experience, age, nationality and gender. This principle is encapsulated in the Axiata Board Composition Framework. Based on this framework, both merit and diversity are factors considered hand in hand when selecting board members.

The formal process involves the BNRC first identifying the gap in Board composition before sourcing for candidates. Subsequently, the BNRC evaluates and recommends to the Board, suitable candidates who fulfil the requirements. Other criteria such as integrity, existing commitments, potential risks and/or conflicts of interest and ability to bring a different perspective and increase diversity of the Board are also considered in the BNRC's review. The process for Board appointment also mandates the BNRC and Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director to engage external consultants and this has been utilised on many occasions.

Given that Axiata has a 9-year policy for independent directorships, the process of succession planning for independent directors retiring upon serving 9 years is also embarked on, typically based on the landscape of retirements over the next two years. This time period allows for the identification and selection of suitable replacements for retiring directors and also provides a transition period to allow for a smooth changeover of duties and responsibilities, not just on the Board but on Committees on which such independent directors serve on. A recent example of this was the redesignation of Thayaparan Sangarapillai to a non-independent director on 30 June 2024 after serving for a period of 9 years as an independent director within the Axiata Group. The process of succession planning for his role as Independent Director and also Chairman of the Audit Committee commenced in the middle of 2023 culminating in the selection and appointment of Madam Amrit Kaur as his successor. A transition and handover period of 6 months was effected with Mr. Thaya stepping down at the end of 2024.

Although Mr Thaya's redesignation to a nonindependent director resulted in the proportion of independent directors on the Board falling marginally below the majority threshold required under Practice 5.2 of the MCCG 2021, the Board's priority was to ensure an orderly and well-planned succession involving both outgoing and incoming directors and their respective roles on the Board and its Committees. However, with the appointment of additional independent directors since then, the requirement has not only been met but surpassed—as of 31 March 2025, there are seven Independent Directors on an eleven-member Board, which is 63.6% of the composition of the Board.

On 25 May 2022, the Board approved a Fit & Proper Policy made effective from 1 July 2022, where the proposed candidates to be appointed to the Board or reappointments of directors to the Board are assessed to determine fitness and probity. This is in keeping with the amendments to the Listing Requirements made by Bursa Securities with the introduction of Chapter 15.01A in 2022.

### **DIRECTORS LIABILITY INSURANCE**

The insurance covers past, present, and future directors with appropriate, limited coverage approved by the Board based on our risk profile.

## EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES

### **Axiata has strengthened its sustainability governance by enhancing alignment with OpCos, ensuring effective implementation of sustainability strategies and initiatives.**

Axiata's Board holds ultimate responsibility over the Group's sustainability agenda and provides oversight of the integration of ESG matters in Axiata's corporate strategy with the aim of balancing stakeholder interests while ensuring that we grow responsibly and create long-term value.

Meanwhile, the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) provides strategic guidance to the Group and resolves matters relating to sustainability practices as well as the preparation of the Group's sustainability related disclosures within the Integrated Annual Report. BSC also has oversight of climate-related matters, including climate risks and opportunities, and was convened eight times in FY2024.

The GCEO and Managing Director is responsible for overall management on sustainability-related matters and also oversees Group Sustainability, while being supported by other senior management members within their areas of responsibility.

Chaired by the GCEO and Managing Director, the Axiata Sustainability Steering Committee (Steering Committee) consists of representatives from Group Sustainability, OpCo Sustainability teams and representatives, and selected Heads or nominees from key Group corporate functions. The Steering Committee is responsible for supporting the management of ESG matters and ensures collaboration to streamline the approach within the Group to achieve Axiata's sustainability agenda and promote sharing.

Group Sustainability leads the development of the overall strategy and framework to drive sustainability initiatives and programmes across the Group in a structured and cohesive way.

On all OpCo Boards and Board Committees, Axiata is represented by its Directors or Senior Leadership representatives. This enables alignment and oversight from the Group to OpCos, including ensuring the integration of sustainability across the organisation. Each OpCo has its own sustainability governance, where sustainability-related matters are elevated to OpCo Board, Board Committee, CEO or Management Committees by Sustainability Teams or representatives.

For FY2024, a key priority was to promote accountability and ensure strategic alignment throughout the OpCos by leveraging on the BRCC of each OpCo. With guidance and support from OpCo BRCCs, the BSC was able to support the Group's and OpCo's sustainability agenda including compliance with ESGrelated regulatory requirements.

## BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS

### **BOARD FOCUS AREAS**

Monitoring of the Company's performance and business planning for the year remain a priority for the Board's deliberation despite a considerable amount of time and attention being devoted to strategic matters and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

The Board also considered new opportunities and new ways of engagement to leverage on the wide range of talent, skill and expertise available within the Group. Efforts were also expanded in assessing the various options available in unearthing and increasing value to and within the Group.

### **BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2024**

- The Board allocated approximately 36.67% of its time in 2024 during Board meetings focusing on strategy, M&A, funding and investment matters.
- At the Board Retreat held in July and November 2024, the Board focused on deliberating on Axiata's strategic direction across its businesses and footprint, taking into account the state of the telecommunications industry and the direction that the industry is heading to Telco to TechCo for fintech and digital telco businesses and strategic options-way forward for Axiata.

### **2025 FOCUS**

The focus for 2025 is continuing Axiata's transformative journey with clear targets to enhance our performance, accelerate value creation, and increase long-term shareholder value. Axiata will focus on our portfolio and business strategy guided by the 5 vectors of value creation and 5 strategic priorities which will steer us on our journey towards becoming the Next Generation Digital Champion, aligned with an aspiration to be recognised as a sustainable dividend company to ensure consistent returns to shareholders.

### **CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS (CODE)**

The Code is in line with the practices in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 as well as the provisions of the Securities Commission Guidelines on the Conduct of Directors of Public Listed Companies issued in July 2020. All of the OpCos adopt a code of conduct similar if not identical, to that of Axiata leading to the shaping of a common ethical culture within the Group. The provisions of the Code are also embedded within the Employees Code of Conduct applicable across the Group.

### **BOARD EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION**

The Board engaged the services of a corporate governance advisory firm (Consultant) to assist with the 2024 Board Effectiveness Evaluation (2024 BEE) of the Board's performance. The 2024 BEE is a follow on from the exercise conducted in 2023 by the same Consultant, providing continuity to the recommendations and suggestions from the year before. Management with the guidance and supervision of the BNRC had adopted and implemented the recommendations and suggestions raised in BEE 2023.

For the 2024 BEE, the salient results, findings, recommendations and suggestions are itemised as follows:-

- All of the ratings were above 4.00 which indicated that the Board is effective and performs well within the parameters and could be an area of strength and a benchmark to others. Board Governance Oversight & Processes ranked highest
- It was found that the Chairman is very effective, provides room, time and platform for all members to voice concerns
- The Axiata Board was commended on the successful execution of the 6-month transition for a former Independent Director and Chairman of the BAC
- The impending retirement of two long serving Board members is a matter that would require attention
- Succession planning for senior management continues to be a challenge which may result in protracted vacancies for key roles
- The Board meets the standards of corporate governance with satisfactory findings in the process of dealing with potential conflicts of interest and confidential information
- Board discussions are open and adopts a consensus-driven process in arriving at decision-making
- Director relations are generally friendly, collegial, and members are professional and respectful of one another with Non-Executive Directors having met amongst themselves regularly
- Board-management relationship is felt to be harmonious and professional with the Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director thought to manage the relationship with the Board well

Following from the conduct of BEE 2024, the findings and recommendations therefrom will be disseminated to the relevant Committees and Management in order to assess the same and formulate remediation and action plans as appropriate.

### **PROFFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION**

New directors receive a comprehensive and tailored induction programme in order that they are fully informed about the Group's activities on joining the Board. They are apprised of the business operations and environment, fiduciary duties and responsibilities, and the Board's expectations in respect of a director's commitment, ethical behaviour and the need to keep abreast of regulatory changes and trends.

Training is an area delegated to the Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee as part of its brief to ensure that the Board continues to possess the skills, experience and knowledge to meet the needs of the business. Training requirements are discussed and relevant and suitable training programmes are periodically made known to the directors, all of which are facilitated and assisted by the Group Company Secretary.

### **BRIEFINGS DURING THE YEAR**

Several of the in-house presentations by external speakers during the course of the year were as follows:

![](_page_119_Figure_33.jpeg)

Induction Programme – all new directors appointed on the Board of Axiata will have the opportunity to attend an Axiata Board Induction as well as induction programmes organised and conducted by OpCos. These programmes by the OpCos are conducted once a year and Axiata Directors are encouraged to participate in at least one of these visits depending on their availability. The Board had the opportunity to visit Robi Axiata and Dialog Axiata in July 2024.

### **2024 DIRECTORS' TRAINING AREAS**

## BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS

On 6 June 2023, Bursa Malaysia issued a letter informing listed companies of an amendment to the Listing Requirements in relation to sustainability training for directors. All Directors of listed companies are required to attend and complete the Mandatory Accreditation Programme (MAP). With the increasing emphasis and importance on matters of sustainability, the MAP is now broken into two parts, with Part I comprising the current contents, and a new Part II compromising matters of sustainability. The new provisions of the Listing Requirements require existing directors of listed companies to attend and complete this new Part II by the stipulated date. Save for Dr Patrick Forth who was appointed to the Board on 28 March 2025, all Directors of Axiata have attended the MAP Part I.

The Group Company Secretarial Division works with the Institute of Corporate Directors Malaysia (ICDM) to update the available training dates from time to time and a few Directors have registered to attend the MAP Part II. As at todate all of the Directors have attended the MAP Part II except for 4 Directors who will be attending the programme not later than September 2026.

### **REMUNERATING FAIRLY Non-Executive Directors (NED)**

As a regional company, the remuneration philosophy is to develop a remuneration structure that commensurate with the Directors' responsibilities at both Board and Board Committee levels and is sufficient to attract, incentivise and retain quality Directors. The remuneration packages differentiate the Chairman and ordinary members of the Board and Board Committee to reflect the larger role and responsibilities of the Chairman.

At the end of 2021, a review of the NEDs' remuneration structure was conducted by a consultant (Consultant) and the analysis and recommendation of the Consultant was tabled to the Board of Axiata in February 2022. From the benchmarking analysis of Axiata against Malaysian similarly sized and regionalbased international telecommunication peers, the recommendation was to increase the Chairman's monthly fees to align with the median and to align Board Committee ratios to P50 of that of similar-sized companies in Malaysia. The BNRC and Board recommended for the increase in monthly fees for the Board Committees and to align the BRCC meeting allowances with that of the BAC, which was subsequently approved by the shareholders at the 30th AGM held in May 2022.

In line with the above proposal, the Board also approved the enhancement of the Board Annual Report Committee (BARC) by adding an additional scope to the committee to oversee the sustainability practices within Axiata Group i.e. to oversee Axiata's sustainability or interchangeably, ESG (which includes climate-related risks and opportunities) related framework, strategy, external commitments, policies and practices as well as performances against such matters including any external ESG ratings or assessments. The BARC was renamed as Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) on 8 April 2022 and the new rate of monthly fees and meeting allowance was also proposed for the BSC.

The following table outlines the remuneration structure for NEDs of the Group in 2024. There is no proposed revision to the remuneration of the Directors for 2025.

*Notes: <sup>1</sup> In accordance with Shareholders' approval, Axiata pays Board and Board Committees' Directors' fees on a monthly basis*

*<sup>2</sup> No new meeting allowance paid if meeting is adjourned to or continued on a different date or time*

*<sup>3</sup> NEC refers to Non-Executive Chairman*

### **Benefits**

Benefits comprises annual overseas business development trips, leave passage, travel allowance, travel allowance for Non-Resident NEDs, equipment, telecommunication facilities, insurance and medical.

### **Executive Directors (EDs)**

The Company's policy on remuneration for the EDs is formulated to ensure competitiveness with the market to attract, retain and motivate an ED of the highest calibre to competently manage the Company.

The remuneration is therefore structured to link various components of the package with corporate and individual performance. It also takes into account total compensation of comparable companies (of similar size and complexity to Axiata locally; and in the same industry in the region), based on benchmarking conducted by independent consultants.

The current remuneration framework of the EDs consists of basic salary, benefits-in-kind and Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributions, as a guaranteed component. On top of this, the EDs are eligible for two types of performancebased incentives which are the Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) linked to a particular financial year's targets and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which is linked to a 3-year long-term target.

For the STIP, the performance of the EDs is measured based on the achievement of the annual KPIs. These KPIs comprise not only quantitative targets, such as annual revenue, EBIT, PATAMI, Operating Free Cash Flow (OFCF) and relative performance of the OpCos, but also qualitative targets which include strategic milestones and initiatives that need to be achieved and implemented in a given year, on areas such as strategy, innovation, business development, synergy, human capital management, financial management and societal development. The weightage of the qualitative and quantitative targets may be adjusted to accommodate the Group's aspirations.

For the LTIP, the performance of the EDs is measured on the achievement of a combination of relative Total Shareholders Return, PATAMI Margin and OFCF Margin within the vesting period.

This is supported by OpCos and key associate's dividend declared of approximately RM1.3 billion in FY2024

### **Capital Structure and Capital Resources**

• The Group's debt to equity gearing ratio (total borrowing including lease liabilities over total equity) stood at 1.2x as at 31 December 2024

### **Total Assets**

- Total assets stood at RM74,355.9 million, decreased by RM4,061.9 million.
- Decrease in assets balance were mainly due to:
  - Property, plant and equipment decreased by RM1,918.2 million, mainly due to lower capex addition of RM3,846.7 million from disciplined capex management
  - Right-of-use assets (ROU) decreased by RM1,166.7 million due to depreciation expense of RM1,912.1 million and foreign exchange translation losses of RM669.8 million offset by additions of RM1,151.0 million
  - Intangible assets decreased by RM661.3 million due to amortisation expense of RM813.5 million and foreign exchange translation losses of RM584.3 million offset with additions of RM402.9 million and acquisition of subsidiaries amounting to RM273.2 million
- Partially offset with increase in the following assets:
- Trade and other receivables increased by RM569.5 million due to inclusion of EDOTCO Myanmar and investment in Malaysian Government Securities' bond by Boost Bank Berhad

### **Capital Allocation**

- With Axiata's multi-country presence, the Group uses the Capital Allocation Framework to guide capital allocation across our businesses into delivering Underlying PATAMI and Earnings Per Share, effectively translating into Total Shareholder Returns. The five guardrails of i) Country allocation, ii) Segment allocation, iii) Affordability, iv) Organic & Inorganic returns and v) Portfolio mix formed the foundation of our Capital Allocation Framework
- As the Group embarks on its next phase of growth guided by Axiata 5\*5 Strategy with five value creation vectors and five strategic priorities, a key aim is to increase transparency of cashflow at Axiata's Company level. The Capital Allocation Framework 2.0 was enhanced to serve as a guide for Axiata Company level on its sustainable cashflow deployment in order to achieve key financial outcomes of:
  - Delivering 10.0 sen DPS p.a to our shareholders and to progressively increase;
  - Retain credit rating with Moody's (Baa2) and S&P (BBB); and
  - Achieve net debt/EBITDA target of 2.5x by end-2026
- As part of the Capital Allocation Framework 2.0, sources of funds have been clearly identified, which includes upstreaming of dividends from OpCos and associates, and proceeds from asset monetisation and value illumination opportunities in achieving the key financial outcomes

### **Key Performance Indicators**

On 22 February 2024, the Group announced its Headline KPIs guidance for the financial year ending 31 December 2024. The Group's reported Headline KPIs for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 were as below:

|                                                    | FY2024<br>Achievement | FY2024<br>Headline KPIs | FY2024<br>Achievement |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|                                                    | @ Actual currency     |                         | @ Constant rate1      |  |
| Revenue Growth2                                    | 0.0%                  | Mid-single digit        | 1.9%                  |  |
| Earnings Before Interest, and Tax (EBIT)2,3 Growth | 35.6%                 | Mid-teens               | 39.3%                 |  |

The Group posted strong underlying operational performance in financial year ended 31 December 2024 with revenue growth across all OpCos except for Link Net in Indonesia and Dialog in Sri Lanka. EBIT reported double-digit growth primarily contributed by XL in Indonesia, EDOTCO, Robi in Bangladesh and Smart in Cambodia due to topline expansion and cost management excellence at both opex and capex. PATAMI improved mainly due to flow through from higher EBIT, moderated by lower share of results of associates and higher taxation.

For the Group's digital telcos, revenue growth was mainly driven by XL in Indonesia and Smart in Cambodia, primarily from ARPU uplift. Robi in Bangladesh and Dialog in Sri Lanka are operating in challenging macroeconomic environments. Despite the challenges, cost discipline delivered EBIT growth at both Robi and Dialog.

For the Group's infrastructure businesses, revenue growth was mainly driven by EDOTCO Group, from additional towers and increase in tenancies predominantly from Malaysia, Bangladesh and Philippines. Link Net in Indonesia delivered lower revenue and EBIT growth due to slower orders and the transfer of residential customers as part of the delayering exercise for its transition to a fibre company.

For the Group's digital businesses, Boost's revenue improved on the back of growth in Boost Credit and Boost Connect, resulting in losses narrowing, in spite of startup investment in Boost Bank Berhad. ADA registered growth for revenue and EBIT largely driven by the Customer Engagement and eCommerce segments.

Despite challenges in the frontier markets, and a competitive operating environment in the telecommunications sector, the Group posted EBIT growth of 39.3%, ahead of its mid teens growth target for 2024, mainly due to cost and capex management initiatives across the Group, while the Group's revenue growth of 1.9% was below its target of mid-single digit growth.

## OUR SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE

Axiata's share price ended 2024 at RM2.49, a 4.6% increase over FY2023, placing it as the FBMKLCI's 23rd largest company by market capitalisation at RM22.9 billion.

Axiata's share price performance for the first half of 2024 was positive on the back of upbeat market sentiment in the local economy and the FBMKLCI. There were also several corporate announcements from Axiata which lifted its performance, including EDOTCO's plans to exit its Myanmar operations, the signing of the Definitive Agreement to merge the operations of Dialog Axiata with Airtel Lanka in Sri Lanka, as well as the MoU signed between Axiata and Sinar Mas for the proposed merger of XL Axiata and Smartfren in Indonesia.

In the third quarter of 2024, there were some negative events that affected Axiata's share price, including the social unrest, flooding and economic challenges in Bangladesh.

In the fourth quarter, positive Q324 results, and the announcement of the merger of XL Axiata and Smartfren in December helped to lift the share price at the end of the year.

## OUR DIVIDEND POLICY

Following a resilient performance in FY2024, Axiata declared a second interim dividend of 5.0 sen per share in February 2025, culminating in a total annual dividend of 10.0 sen per share for the year ending on 31 December 2024. This total includes an initial interim dividend of 5.0 sen.

The Board maintains its commitment to the established dividend policy, under which the Company aims to distribute dividends amounting to a minimum of 30% of its normalised Group Profit After Tax and Minority Interests (PATAMI), while also seeking to gradually increase the dividend payout ratio, taking into account various considerations such as the Group's future prospects, capital requirements and surplus, strategies for growth and expansion, considerations for non-operational items, and other factors deemed pertinent by the Board.

<sup>2</sup> DPR – Dividend payout ratio excluding special dividend

<sup>3</sup> The Group announced lower DPR in 2016 and 2017 based on two reasons. First, for prudent reasons, to mitigate against impacts of volatile forex and regulatory risk. Second, for strategic reasons, to enable 4G/data leadership investments as well as for possible mergers and acquisitions (M&A) exercises in the areas of market consolidation. Axiata reverted to DPR of 85% in 2018
