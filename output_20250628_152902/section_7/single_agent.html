    <p>Note: The instruction for "Cash conversion (EBITDA / (EBITDA/Capex))" simplifies mathematically to Capex. For a more relevant cash conversion metric, Operating Cash Flow (OCF) as a percentage of revenue (OCF Margin) has been provided above.</p>

    <h4>Key Recent Trends:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Consolidated revenue remained relatively flat year-on-year in FY2024, increasing by a modest 0.5% to S$191.3 million. However, this masks a strategic shift: the core manufacturing segment's revenue grew by a strong 10.5% to S$114.9 million, driven by higher order volumes and new projects. The discontinued supply chain management services segment saw a decline in revenue from S$86.4 million in FY2023 to S$76.4 million in FY2024. Interim performance shows a significant revenue increase in 1H2024, primarily due to the supply chain segment prior to its cessation, followed by a sharp decline in 2H2024 post-cessation.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin Evolution:</strong> The Group's overall gross profit margin improved significantly from 7.0% in FY2023 to 8.9% in FY2024, outpacing revenue growth. This improvement was largely driven by the manufacturing segment, which saw its gross profit margin expand from 11.7% to 13.5%. The EBITDA from continuing operations dramatically improved, turning positive at S$8.5 million in FY2024 from S$0.6 million in FY2023, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency. Consequently, operating income for continuing operations turned positive in FY2024 (S$0.46 million) from a substantial loss in FY2023, and net loss from continuing operations narrowed sharply.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Flow Generation:</strong> The Group significantly improved its cash flow generation, moving from a net operating cash outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024. This was primarily due to lower pre-tax losses. Capital expenditure increased notably in FY2024 to S$6.94 million (3.63% of revenue), indicating investment in factory equipment, plant, and machinery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. MDNA highlighting key recent trends:</h3>

    <h4>2 Key Achievements:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Significant Turnaround in Core Manufacturing Profitability and Efficiency:</strong> Fu Yu's manufacturing segment demonstrated a remarkable recovery in FY2024. The segment's gross profit margin improved from 11.7% to 13.5%<a href="#fn28"><sup>28</sup></a>, and most notably, EBITDA from continuing operations surged to S$8.5 million in FY2024 from a mere S$0.6 million in FY2023<a href="#fn34"><sup>34</sup></a>. This operational improvement led to a sharp narrowing of net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million to S$1.2 million<a href="#fn59"><sup>59</sup></a>, driven by higher order volumes, new project wins, and lower operating costs related to labor and energy<a href="#fn97"><sup>97</sup></a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Successful Strategic Re-focus and Order Book Growth:</strong> The Group's strategic transformation, focusing on high-precision manufacturing, advanced tooling, and the introduction of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team, has begun to bear fruit. This led to securing new projects in higher-margin categories such as medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances<a href="#fn98"><sup>98</sup></a>. As a direct result, the Group's order book at the end of FY2024 increased by 20% year-on-year<a href="#fn99"><sup>99</sup></a>, positioning the company for long-term sustainable revenue.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2 Key Challenges:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cessation of Supply Chain Operations Amidst Ongoing Investigation:</strong> The decision to cease all business activities in the supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) was attributed to the inability to identify suitable leadership to effectively run the business<a href="#fn100"><sup>100</sup></a>. This cessation was concurrently announced with an internal audit report highlighting "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management processes and an ongoing external investigation into purported misuse of resources and irregular transactions<a href="#fn101"><sup>101</sup></a>. This situation presents significant operational, financial, and reputational challenges, with potential claims against certain individuals still under investigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Headwinds in China Operations and Geopolitical Uncertainty:</strong> While Singapore and Malaysia operations showed strong growth, the China segment experienced an 11.8% decline in revenue<a href="#fn102"><sup>102</sup></a> due to slower business activities and a weaker-than-expected economic recovery in the region<a href="#fn103"><sup>103</sup></a>. This is compounded by geopolitical uncertainty and potential US-China trade tensions, prompting the Group to focus its China facilities on "China-for-China and China-for-Asia" strategies<a href="#fn104"><sup>104</sup></a>, indicating a challenging and evolving operating landscape.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Discrepancy in Stated Reason for Supply Chain Segment Cessation:</strong> Management's stated reason for discontinuing the supply chain management services segment was the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business"<a href="#fn100"><sup>100</sup></a>. However, the accompanying financial documents and corporate governance report disclose that this cessation followed an internal audit report indicating "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process" and an ongoing investigation into "purported misuse of FYSCS’s resources" and irregular payments<a href="#fn101"><sup>101</sup></a>. This suggests a more severe underlying issue as the primary driver for discontinuing the segment, which is a significant disconnect from the initially presented rationale.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial Achievement of Carbon Emissions Reduction Target:</strong> The Group set a short-term target in FY2023 to reduce Scope 2 carbon emissions by 3.0% in FY2024, using FY2023 as the baseline<a href="#fn105"><sup>105</sup></a>. While the Group achieved a reduction, the actual performance fell short of the target, with only a 1.4% reduction<a href="#fn105"><sup>105</sup></a>. This indicates that despite efforts, the ambitious target was not fully met, highlighting a gap between the stated sustainability goal and its realization.</li>
