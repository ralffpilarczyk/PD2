Here's a rating of your draft:

## Section 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

### 1. Completeness (all requirements met)

*   **Score: 9/10**
*   **Specific Issues to Fix:**
    *   **No major issues.** The draft comprehensively covers all requirements outlined in its introduction: annual and interim periods, key financial metrics, trend evolution, performance assessment, and management insights. The proactive handling of the "continuing vs. discontinued operations" distinction and the "Cash Conversion" formula demonstrates thoroughness. The 'N/A' for some FY2022 data is clearly explained as a data availability issue rather than an omission.

### 2. Accuracy (facts correct with sources)

*   **Score: 9.5/10**
*   **Specific Issues to Fix:**
    *   **No issues to fix based on the provided text.** The draft exhibits excellent commitment to accuracy. All data points in the tables are meticulously sourced with document and page references. Complex calculations (like EBITDA) are explained with their components and sources, which is highly commendable. The explicit reinterpretation and explanation of the "Cash Conversion" metric prevent misrepresentation of potentially flawed source prompt information, showing a strong dedication to accuracy and analytical integrity. (Note: Actual verification of numbers against external source documents is beyond the scope of this review but the methodology is sound).

### 3. Clarity (well-structured)

*   **Score: 9/10**
*   **Specific Issues to Fix:**
    *   **Consistency in Decimal Places:** While generally good, ensure consistent use of decimal places across the tables for presentation. For example, some calculated 1H figures might imply more decimal places than presented for FY/2H figures (e.g., 126.7 could be 126.713 from the calculation). Decide on a consistent rounding rule (e.g., one decimal place for all S$ Million figures) and apply it uniformly. This is a very minor aesthetic point.
    *   **Optional: Concluding Sentence:** Consider adding a very brief concluding sentence or two at the very end of the entire Section 7 to summarize the overall financial narrative (e.g., highlighting the strategic shift's impact and future outlook), providing a sense of closure to the section.

### 4. Conciseness (no fluff)

*   **Score: 9/10**
*   **Specific Issues to Fix:**
    *   **No significant issues.** The draft is remarkably concise given the amount of detailed financial information and analysis it provides. Information is presented efficiently using tables and bullet points. While source notes are detailed, they are essential for accuracy and transparency rather than being "fluff." The language is direct and professional, avoiding unnecessary jargon or verbose explanations.

**Overall Feedback:**

This is an **excellent draft**. You've done a fantastic job of compiling, analyzing, and presenting complex financial information clearly and accurately. Your proactive approach to addressing potential data ambiguities (continuing/discontinued operations, cash conversion formula) is a significant strength. The detailed sourcing is also top-tier. With minor refinements, this section will be very strong.
