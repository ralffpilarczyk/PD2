## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Overall, Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance for the last 24 months, particularly in its core manufacturing segment, demonstrates a positive trajectory amidst a challenging environment. This improvement is primarily driven by robust revenue growth, a notable expansion in gross profit margins, and a commendable reduction in environmental intensity. The strategic pivot towards high-precision manufacturing, coupled with investments in operational efficiencies and sustainability initiatives, appears to be yielding tangible benefits, as evidenced by increased order volumes and improved cost structures. However, the recent cessation of the supply chain management services segment, amidst an ongoing investigation into its affairs, introduces a critical caveat to the overall operational narrative, suggesting that the "reallocation of resources" may be a forced rather than purely strategic move.

### Top 3 Most Important Operating Metrics:

The three most important operating metrics materially impacting Fu Yu Corporation Limited's economic performance over the last 24 months are **Manufacturing Revenue Growth**, **Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**, and **GHG Emissions Intensity**. These metrics provide crucial insights into the Company's market traction, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability, respectively.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                     | Period      | Value (S$ Million) | Growth (%)       | Source                                       |
|:---------------------------|:------------|:-------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Manufacturing Revenue      | FY2023      | 103.9              | N/A              | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4         |
| Manufacturing Revenue      | H1 2023     | 52.6               | N/A              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)             |
| Manufacturing Revenue      | H2 2023     | 51.3               | N/A              | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                          |
| Manufacturing Revenue      | FY2024      | 114.9              | 10.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.4         |
| Manufacturing Revenue      | H1 2024     | 54.8               | 4.06% (YoY H1)   | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13 (calculated)             |
| Manufacturing Revenue      | H2 2024     | 60.1               | 17.18% (YoY H2)  | Fu Yu FS Q424, p.13                          |

*Calculations for H1 Revenue:* H1 2023 = FY2023 Revenue - H2 2023 Revenue = S$103.9M - S$51.3M = S$52.6M. H1 2024 = FY2024 Revenue - H2 2024 Revenue = S$114.9M - S$60.1M = S$54.8M.

**Benchmarking:**
No direct industry-specific revenue growth benchmarks are provided in the documents. However, the 10.5% growth in the core manufacturing segment for FY2024 is significant in the context of a "challenging operating environment" and "slower-than-expected recovery in China's economy" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 8; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31). This suggests outperformance relative to general economic headwinds.

**Analysis of Drivers:**
The growth was driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.30). The introduction of a New Product Introduction ("NPI") team and investment in advanced tooling capabilities facilitated these project wins, especially in higher-margin product categories (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). Geographically, strong growth in Singapore (+20.9% to S$46.2M) and Malaysia (+24.9% to S$36.6M) offset an 11.8% decline in China (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.8). The Company also boasts a refreshed customer base including "global leaders in wound care and personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
The trend of growth appears sustainable, supported by several factors:
1.  **Increased Order Book:** The order book at the end of FY2024 increased 20% year-on-year, with "higher order volumes and interest in increasing order volumes from existing customers" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31).
2.  **"Sticky" Projects:** High-precision tooling projects are described as having a "relatively 'sticky' nature," translating into "long-term sustainable revenue" as they transition to mass production (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6; Fu Yu FS Q424, p.31).
3.  **Geographical Flexibility:** The Singapore-headquartered company offers geographical flexibility with production in Singapore, Malaysia, and China, which is beneficial amid geopolitical uncertainties (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).
4.  **Smart Factory Capabilities:** Continued leverage of the Smart Factory for high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and cleanroom manufacturing positions the company for future growth (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:**
The 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue (S$11.0 million increase) was the primary driver for the Group's overall revenue increase of 0.5% (S$0.9 million) for FY2024, despite a S$10.0 million decline in the now-discontinued supply chain segment (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). This growth significantly contributed to narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024 (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7).

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What is the specific breakdown of the 20% year-on-year order book increase at FY2024 by customer (new vs. existing) and product segment, and what is the anticipated revenue conversion rate from this order book for FY2025 and FY2026?
2.  Given the decline in China operations, what specific strategic adjustments and customer acquisition plans are in place to mitigate further revenue risk from this region and what is the expected timeline for its recovery?

### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Definition and Relevance:**
Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin is the gross profit generated from the manufacturing segment as a percentage of its revenue. It is a critical indicator of the Company's pricing power, cost control effectiveness, and the profitability of its core production processes. A higher GPM indicates efficient operations, favorable unit economics, and the ability to command better prices for its products.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                       | Period | Value     | Change (ppt) | Source                |
|:-----------------------------|:-------|:----------|:-------------|:----------------------|
| Manufacturing Gross Profit   | FY2023 | S$12.1M   | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM            | FY2023 | 11.7%     | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit   | FY2024 | S$15.5M   | N/A          | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |
| Manufacturing GPM            | FY2024 | 13.5%     | +1.8 ppt     | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7      |

**Benchmarking:**
The documents do not provide direct GPM benchmarks against specific competitors or industry averages. However, the improvement from 11.7% to 13.5% is a significant positive trend, especially when juxtaposed with overall market challenges. The emphasis on "higher-margin product categories" suggests a strategic shift that aims to improve GPM beyond mere cost cutting (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6).

**Analysis of Drivers:**
The 1.8 percentage point improvement in manufacturing GPM was primarily driven by the Company's strategic transformation focusing on "high-precision manufacturing" and the successful securing of "new projects... particularly those in higher-margin product categories" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). The New Product Introduction (NPI) team played a role in enabling these project wins, demonstrating the ability to "add value in the early stages of the business cycle" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6). This indicates a deliberate shift towards more profitable offerings rather than just volume expansion.

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
The sustained improvement in GPM is likely given the Company's stated forward strategies. The focus on "high-precision projects" and "moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6) suggests a continued emphasis on higher-margin work. The Group's Smart Factory, capable of complex mould inserts and 3D metal printing, supports this move up the value chain (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.2, 6).

**Quantification of Financial Impact:**
The 1.8 percentage point increase in manufacturing GPM, from 11.7% to 13.5%, resulted in an increase of S$3.4 million in gross profit for the manufacturing segment (S$15.5M in FY2024 vs. S$12.1M in FY2023) (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.7). This substantial contribution to profitability was a key factor in the sharp narrowing of the Group's net loss from continuing operations.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  Can management provide a segment-level gross profit margin breakdown for the manufacturing business by key product categories (e.g., medical devices, consumer products, industrial) for the last 24 months, to understand the drivers of margin expansion and the sustainability of the "higher-margin product categories" strategy?
2.  What is the Company's strategy for managing raw material costs and labor productivity in the manufacturing segment to sustain or further improve GPM, especially as order volumes increase?

### 3. GHG Emissions Intensity (Manufacturing Segment)

**Definition and Relevance:**
GHG Emissions Intensity measures the total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per S$ million of manufacturing revenue. This metric reflects the environmental efficiency of the Company's operations and its progress towards decarbonization. It is relevant to economic performance by indicating compliance risk (e.g., carbon taxes), energy cost efficiency, brand reputation, and access to "green" financing and environmentally conscious customers.

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Metric                         | Period | Value (tCO2e/S$ mil revenue) | Reduction (%)    | Source           |
|:-------------------------------|:-------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| GHG Emissions Intensity        | FY2023 | 214.4                        | N/A              | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| GHG Emissions Intensity        | FY2024 | 191.9                        | 10.5% (YoY)      | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.40 |
| Total Electricity Consumption  | FY2023 | 116,481.6 GJ                 | N/A              | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |
| Total Electricity Consumption  | FY2024 | 113,623.0 GJ                 | 2.5% (YoY)       | Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38 |

**Benchmarking:**
No specific industry benchmark is provided. However, a 10.5% reduction in GHG emissions intensity year-on-year is a significant improvement, demonstrating tangible progress in environmental performance. The company's target to reduce Scope 2 overall emissions by 30% by FY2030 (using FY2023 as baseline) and a short-term target of 3.0% reduction in FY2024 (achieved 1.4%) indicates a proactive approach to sustainability (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.41).

**Analysis of Drivers:**
The reduction in GHG Emissions Intensity is primarily driven by:
1.  **Energy Efficiency Initiatives:** Investment in energy-efficient electric machines (replacing older hydraulic ones) and upgrading to LED lighting, leading to a 2.5% decrease in purchased electricity consumption (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38).
2.  **Renewable Energy Adoption:** Installation of solar panels on Singapore facilities (completed FY2024), and ongoing expansion in Malaysia (Fu Hao operational Q4 FY2024, CA by Q2 FY2025). In FY2024, 4,001.8 GJ of solar energy was generated for on-site operations (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.6, 38, 47).
3.  **Operational Optimization:** Measures like optimizing production planning to reduce machinery idling time and use of frequency conversion air compressors (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38).

**Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:**
The trend is highly sustainable due to ongoing strategic investments and explicit targets. The Company is actively "exploring and implementing cleaner energy solutions including transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar power" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.17). The integration of Industry 4.0 Smart Factory capabilities also aids in monitoring and optimizing electricity usage (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.47). The Company aims to maintain/reduce water consumption (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.42) and hazardous/non-hazardous waste (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.45), which indirectly supports environmental efficiency.

**Quantification of Financial Impact:**
While a precise monetary value for the GHG intensity reduction is not provided, the related reduction in purchased electricity consumption (2.5% or 2,858.6 GJ) directly contributes to **cost savings** on energy bills. The Company explicitly states that this initiative "unlocket significant cost savings for our business" and aims "to mitigate the impact of rising energy costs" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38, 32). The generation of 4,001.8 GJ of solar energy for own use provides energy cost stability and future energy independence. Furthermore, the ability to generate and sell Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) (3,996.0 GJ in FY2024, Fu Yu 24 AR, p.38) offers a direct **revenue generation** opportunity. Indirectly, strong climate-related practices lead to "improved access to capital, and opportunities for green financing" and potentially "increased investor confidence" (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.37), and enhanced reputation to attract environmentally conscious customers (Fu Yu 24 AR, p.33, 36).

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  Can the Company provide a quantified breakdown of the energy cost savings (actual and projected for FY2025) derived from efficiency improvements and solar panel installations in each region, and how these savings impact the overall cost per unit of production?
2.  What is the detailed roadmap and capital expenditure plan to achieve the 30% Scope 2 emissions reduction target by FY2030, including specific technology upgrades, estimated costs, and anticipated financial returns on these investments?
