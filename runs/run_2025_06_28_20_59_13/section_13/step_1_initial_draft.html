    </ol>

    <h3>c. Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies:</h3>
    <p>While Fu Yu's objectives and strategies are largely aligned, a notable disconnect arises concerning the strategic ambition for 'sustainable growth and enhanced financial performance' in light of the recent challenges and eventual discontinuation of the Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS) segment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="data-point"><strong>Operational and Governance Disconnect in FYSCS:</strong> The decision to discontinue the FYSCS segment was due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" and "significant weaknesses" highlighted by an internal audit, leading to an ongoing investigation into "purported misuse of FYSCS's resources" and "irregular expense claims."<sup>65</sup> This situation reveals a significant disconnect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective (Growth & Performance) vs. Strategy (Operational Oversight):</strong> The objective is to achieve sustainable growth and improve financial performance by emphasizing core manufacturing and strategic reallocation. However, the issues within FYSCS indicate a failure in initial due diligence, talent acquisition, operational oversight, and risk management processes for a segment that was initially considered a growth area. This undermines the foundational principles of controlled expansion and efficient resource utilization that are critical for achieving broader strategic financial objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Implications:</strong> While the cessation of FYSCS allows for resource reallocation to the core manufacturing business (which is a sound strategic move in itself), the underlying reasons for its failure (management issues, governance weaknesses, potential financial improprieties) represent a historical operational and strategic misstep. The ongoing investigation and potential claims of S$1.67 million from Evertree Hongkong Limited indicate material financial and reputational risks that have materialized, directly impacting the financial performance in FY2024.<sup>66</sup> The auditors have also issued a qualified opinion on the financial statements due to the ongoing investigation into FYSCS, indicating that its internal controls and risk management systems "may be inadequate."<sup>67</sup> This suggests a past disconnect in ensuring adequate controls and governance in pursuit of business growth.</li>
