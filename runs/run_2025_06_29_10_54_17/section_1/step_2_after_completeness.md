## Section 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

**Executive Summary:**
Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("the Group"), a prominent high-precision plastic and metal component manufacturer, strategically operates across 6 sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China. Its core strategy emphasizes high-precision manufacturing, supported by investments in automation and renewable energy, including a flagship Smart Factory in Singapore. A significant operational shift involved ceasing its supply chain segment (FYSCS) to reallocate resources, though this decision is critically viewed due to an ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs, which led to a qualified audit opinion. The Group's structure leverages vertical integration, geographical flexibility, and advanced technology for competitive positioning.

### C. Employee Distribution and Human Resources

The workforce composition and management practices underpin the Group's operations.

**Employee Distribution**

| Metric                  | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Latest Interim (e.g., Q1 FY2025) | Source                                        |
| :---------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |

| **By Region:** Singapore | 484    | N/A    | N/A    | N/A                               | AR, p.49, "Total Number of Employees"         |

| **By Age (30-50%)**     | 61.4%  | N/A    | N/A    | N/A                               | SR, p.56, "Percentage of Employees" (Total)   |

*   *Note: Employee distribution by specific functions (e.g., R&D, manufacturing departments) is not explicitly disclosed.*

**Hiring and Turnover & Human Capital Metrics**

| Metric                      | FY2024  | FY2023  | FY2022  | Latest Interim (e.g., Q1 FY2025) | Source                                        |
| :-------------------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **New Hire Rate**           | 26.7%   | 60.7%   | 57.4%   | N/A                               | AR, p.49, "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate"     |
| **Turnover Rate**           | 24.9%   | 63.8%   | 59.7%   | N/A                               | AR, p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover"  |
| **Avg Training Hrs/Emp**    | 13.2 hrs | 16 hrs  | N/A     | N/A                               | SR, p.57, "Training and Education"            |
| **Work-related Injury Rate**| 4.6     | 3.5     | N/A     | N/A                               | SR, p.60, "Occupational Health and Safety"    |

*   **Commentary:** The significant drop in FY2024 new hire and turnover rates is primarily due to excluding outsourced workers from the calculation, impacting direct year-on-year comparability. [AR, p.49, Footnote 12; p.51, Footnote 13] Average training hours decreased in FY2024 due to budget controls, with a target of 15 hours for FY2025. The work-related injury rate increased, prompting enhanced safety measures.

### D. Significant Changes and Trends in the Operating Footprint

The Group's operating footprint reflects strategic transformation.

*   **Cessation of Supply Chain Management (FYSCS):** The Group ceased FYSCS operations in Q4 FY2024 to reallocate resources to core manufacturing. FYSCS contributed 39.9% of Group revenue in FY2024 (down from 45.4% in FY2023). [AR, p.9, p.6]
    *   **Critical Stance:** Management's stated reason for cessation ("inability to identify a suitable candidate") appears to downplay the severity. This decision coincides with an ongoing investigation into "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management, "unverifiable arrangements" leading to a multi-million dollar payment, unauthorized email usage, and irregular expense claims. The auditor's qualified opinion on the financial statements specifically highlights this unresolved issue, indicating a systemic governance and operational failure rather than a mere personnel gap. [AR, p.6, p.100, p.171-172; FS, p.26]
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing & Automation:**
    *   The flagship Smart Factory at 9 Tuas Drive 1 in Singapore, equipped with Industry 4.0 machinery, including 3D metal printing and a 100K-class cleanroom, is central to this shift. [AR, p.5]
    *   Automation aims to increase toolroom production (potentially 40% downtime reduction) and includes replacing hydraulic machinery with electric alternatives. [AR, p.6; SR, p.32, p.47]
    *   Digital transformation includes completion of ERP integration and a paperless mould-making process. [AR, p.6; SR, p.47]
    *   Precision manufacturing is stabilizing at 5-micron levels and aiming higher. [AR, p.6]
*   **Renewable Energy Integration:** Solar panel installations on Singapore facilities were completed in FY2024, with Malaysian sites operational in Q4 FY2024 and Q2 FY2025, contributing up to 3,233 MWh annually. [AR, p.5; SR, p.47]
*   **Waste and Water Management Improvements:** FY2024 saw a 9.1% decrease in water consumption (89.1 Megaliter) and a 25.7% reduction in hazardous waste. Rainwater harvesting and increased use of reusable containers (saving over 300 tonnes of paper annually in Singapore) are also notable. [SR, p.42-45]

---

### E. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The Group's operating structure strategically enhances its competitive edge.

*   **Vertical Integration:** Offering a "one-stop solution" from design to assembly streamlines processes for clients, fostering long-term partnerships. [AR, p.2; SR, p.18]
*   **High-End Precision & Advanced Capabilities:** Facilities like the Smart Factory, 100K-class cleanroom, and 3D printing enable high-end precision manufacturing, supported by a New Product Introduction (NPI) team for higher-margin projects. [AR, p.2, p.5]
*   **Geographical Flexibility:** Multi-country facilities provide customers with diverse sourcing options, mitigating geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions, enhancing attractiveness. [AR, p.6; SR, p.33-34]
*   **Sustainability as a Differentiator:** Investments in solar energy, energy-efficient machinery, and exploration of eco-friendly materials align with growing customer preferences for sustainable practices, bolstering reputation and opening green financing opportunities. [SR, p.36-37]
*   **Operational Efficiency:** ERP implementation, automation, and continuous improvement practices (Lean, MES) aim to boost productivity, reduce downtime, and improve cost efficiency, vital for competitiveness. [AR, p.6; SR, p.14, p.47]

### G. Critical Observations and Red Flags

1.  **FYSCS Governance Failure:** Management's benign explanation for discontinuing FYSCS ("inability to identify a suitable candidate") is contradicted by the simultaneous disclosure of a serious investigation into "significant weaknesses" in risk management, "unverifiable arrangements," and "irregular expense claims." This indicates a fundamental governance and operational failure with unknown financial implications, reflected in the auditor's qualified opinion. [AR, p.6, p.100, p.171-172; FS, p.26]
2.  **Employee Data Comparability:** The exclusion of outsourced workers from FY2024 employee metrics significantly distorts the comparability of historical new hire and turnover rates (FY2022-2023). This makes it difficult to assess true underlying workforce stability trends over time. [AR, p.49, p.51, footnotes 12 & 13]
3.  **Ambiguous Solar Energy Impact:** While solar installations generate 3,233 MWh, the overall energy consumption only slightly decreased (1.0% increase overall, 2.5% decrease in purchased electricity) in FY2024. The full operational benefit or offset from solar energy is not clearly quantified against total consumption, leading to ambiguity regarding its impact on efficiency or costs. [AR, p.5, p.38]
4.  **Increasing Injury Rate:** Despite stated commitment to safety, the "recordable work-related injuries rate" increased in FY2024 from 3.5 to 4.6. This upward trend warrants closer scrutiny to ensure current safety measures are effective and not just reactively "reiterated." [SR, p.60]
5.  **Data Gaps:** Key operational metrics like the quantitative "number of customers" and detailed "employee distribution by functions" were not disclosed. Furthermore, comprehensive data for the "5 most recent interim periods" across various metrics was not available in the provided annual and sustainability reports, limiting deeper trend analysis beyond annual figures.
6.  **Absence of Benchmarks:** The provided reports do not include specific industry benchmarks for operational metrics (e.g., efficiency, safety rates) against which the Group's performance could be directly compared.
