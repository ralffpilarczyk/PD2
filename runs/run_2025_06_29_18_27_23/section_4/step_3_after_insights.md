## SECTION 4: Key Suppliers Analysis

Maxis Berhad's supplier relationships are crucial for its operations as a leading integrated telecommunications provider in Malaysia. The company's supply chain encompasses various services, from network infrastructure and maintenance to content delivery and corporate support. Maxis emphasizes managing supply chain risks and fostering ethical and sustainable supplier relationships, though a comprehensive understanding requires scrutiny beyond high-level statements.

### a. List of Largest Suppliers and Supplier Concentration

Maxis provides detailed information on its related party transactions, which, while significant in terms of disclosure, represent a relatively small portion of its overall procurement. A critical analytical gap remains, however, as specific non-related major suppliers—such as key network equipment vendors (e.g., Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia)—are not individually named with transaction values. This omission prevents a full assessment of critical dependencies, technological lock-in risks, and exposure to geopolitical factors impacting core infrastructure.

*Percentage of Maxis's reported total supplier allocation of RM7.1 billion in 2024. For 2023, the total allocated to suppliers in RM is not explicitly stated, though the proportion of local spending is.
*Less than RM1 million.

While the table above details Maxis's related-party supplier expenditures, it reveals that these transactions, totaling RM179 million in 2024, constitute a mere 2.52% of the company's total reported supplier allocation of RM7.1 billion. This contradicts the initial assertion that related parties represent a "significant portion" of overall procurement, suggesting that the primary supplier concentration risk likely lies with undisclosed non-related parties.

The collective expenditure on local versus foreign suppliers is disclosed, providing some insight into the geographical mix of Maxis's supply chain:
*   **Local Suppliers:** RM6.1 billion (86%) in 2024. The proportion remained 86% in 2023.
*   **Foreign Suppliers:** RM1.0 billion (14%) in 2024.

This indicates a strong reliance on local sourcing, which can enhance supply chain resilience and reduce foreign exchange exposure. However, the 14% foreign component still implies a degree of vulnerability to international logistics disruptions, trade policies, and currency fluctuations, particularly for critical imported network equipment.

### b. Supplier Risk Management and Performance

Maxis highlights its commitment to managing supply chain risks and fostering ethical and sustainable relationships. Beyond boilerplate statements, the company details specific mechanisms. Its supply chain management operates under a structured framework guided by the Maxis Procurement Policy, which covers supplier onboarding, sourcing, selection, and evaluation based on technical and commercial criteria.

To mitigate risks, Maxis conducts periodic procurement risk assessments to identify potential disruptions and ensure operational standards are met. Ethical conduct is emphasized through mandatory adherence to the Maxis Code of Business Practice (MCOBP) for Third Parties and Integrity Pledge Statements, which all procurement vendors must acknowledge. Employees also receive annual training on the Maxis Code of Conduct.

In terms of performance, Maxis introduced a Vendor Performance Evaluation (VPE) in January 2024, assessing 362 contracts from 252 vendors. The reported outcome indicated that 89% of these vendors met or exceeded a baseline score of 80%. While this suggests a generally high level of satisfaction, the identified areas for improvement, such as "project management efficiency, timely submission of documentation, and more proactive communication on issue resolution," indicate persistent operational challenges. The company also employs strategies like maintaining constant dialogue with critical suppliers, exploring alternative sourcing, and inserting risk/indemnity clauses in contracts to manage potential failures.

Despite these efforts, the analysis is limited by the absence of specific, measurable KPIs for individual or categories of critical non-related suppliers. While the VPE provides an aggregate score, a deeper understanding of Maxis's ability to control costs, ensure long-term supply chain resilience, and drive innovation through its supplier base remains constrained by this lack of granular data and specific commercial terms (e.g., typical contract lengths for major infrastructure vendors).
