The company's operational presence is characterized by a multi-national manufacturing footprint, significant production capacity, and a strategically evolving employee base. Its physical and human resources are distributed to support a vertically-integrated business model focused on high-precision components, with a recent pivot to higher-margin sectors and sustainability.

### Operational Presence and Scale

**a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions**

| :---------------------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :------------------------ |
| Total Employees (Group) | 1,372    | 1,488    | 1,535    | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 49] |
| Permanent Employees     | 1,241    | -        | -        | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 48] |
| Temporary Employees     | 131      | -        | -        | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 48] |

**Employee Distribution by Region (FY2024)** Source: [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 49]

| Region    | Total Employees | Male | Female |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :--- | :----- |
| Singapore | 484             | 203  | 281    |
| Malaysia  | 358             | 204  | 154    |
| China     | 530             | 279  | 251    |
| **Total** | **1,372**       | **686** | **686** |

**Employee Turnover Rate (Group)** Source: [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 51]

| Metric              | FY2024   | FY2023   | FY2022   |
| :------------------ | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| Turnover Rate       | 24.9%    | 60.7%    | 59.7%    |
| No. of New Hires    | 366      | 903      | 883      |
| New Hire Rate       | 26.7%    | 60.7%    | 57.4%    |

*Anomaly:* The company explicitly states that year-on-year comparisons for employee numbers will be made from FY2025 onwards due to restatement excluding outsourced workers in FY2024. The stated turnover/new hire rates for FY2022 and FY2023 (59.7%, 60.7%) seem significantly high, possibly related to this restatement or high churn before the new calculation method. The target is to maintain the turnover rate (exclusive of temporary workers) below 30%. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 51]

**b. Main Operating Assets and Their Strategic Importance**

*   **Manufacturing Sites:** 6 strategic manufacturing sites located across Singapore, Malaysia, and China. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 2]

*   **Headquarters:** Singapore (8 Tuas Drive 1). [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 2]
*   **Manufacturing Locations:** Singapore (8 Tuas Drive 1, 9 Tuas Drive 1), Malaysia (Penang and Johor), China (Dongguan, Suzhou, Zhuhai). [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 15]
*   **Manufacturing Revenue Contribution by Geography:**

| Region    | FY2024 Revenue (S$M) | FY2023 Revenue (S$M) | FY2024 % Total Mfg. Sales | FY2023 % Total Mfg. Sales | Source                  |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| Singapore | 46.2                 | 38.2                 | 40.2%                     | 36.8%                     | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9] |
| Malaysia  | 36.6                 | 29.3                 | 31.9%                     | 28.2%                     | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9] |

*Alignment:* The diversified geographic footprint across Singapore, Malaysia, and China allows the company to offer **geographical flexibility** in an environment with geopolitical uncertainty, particularly amid US-China trade tensions. This is a key competitive advantage in securing production orders. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6]

**d. Significant Changes or Trends in Operating Footprint**

*   **Cessation of Supply Chain Management Services:** The Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) segment ceased all business activities in Q4 FY2024. This strategic decision was made to reallocate resources to the core manufacturing business and due to the inability to identify suitable leadership for the segment. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, 9, 16; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, page 26]
*   **Geographic Revenue Shift:** Manufacturing revenue contribution has seen an increase from Singapore and Malaysia, while China's contribution has declined, reflecting the company's strategy to balance its geographical presence and reduce reliance on China. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 9]
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing:** Continued investment in the Smart Factory in Singapore, with enhanced automation, 3D metal printing, and cleanroom capabilities. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5]
*   **Renewable Energy Integration:** Installation of solar panels completed at Singapore facilities (FY2024), and progressing in Malaysia (Fu Hao operational Q4 FY2024, Classic Advantage expected Q2 FY2025). This enhances sustainability and mitigates rising energy costs. Total generation capacity up to 3,233 MWh (combined with Singapore facilities). [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, 31, 37, 47]
*   **Operational Efficiency & Digitalization:** Implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform, with testing largely completed in FY2024, aiming for 40% downtime reduction in toolroom automation for overnight/weekend production. Initiatives like paperless mould-making, MES, e-leave, and e-banking are reducing paper usage and enhancing efficiency. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6, 46]
*   **Sustainability Focus:** Reduction in energy consumption (electricity down 2.5% to 113,623.0 GJ in FY2024 from 116,481.6 GJ in FY2023), water consumption (down 9.1% to 89.1 MegaLiter in FY2024 from 98.0 MegaLiter in FY2023), and hazardous waste generated (down 25.7% to 56.4 tonnes in FY2024 from 76.0 tonnes in FY2023). [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 20, 38, 43, 45]

**e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning**

*   **Vertically Integrated Services:** Provides a one-stop solution from product design to tooling, production, assembly, and testing. This enhances value-add and fosters long-term customer partnerships. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 2, 18]
*   **High-Precision Specialization:** Focus on high-end precision plastic and metal components, particularly for life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive, and industrial sectors. The Smart Factory enables complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, and 5-micron precision levels. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 2, 6]
*   **Market Diversification & New Product Introduction (NPI):** Active project wins in medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances demonstrate successful expansion of the customer base and entry into higher-margin product categories. The NPI team adds value in early stages of the business cycle. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, 12]
*   **Global Sourcing and Flexibility:** The multi-country manufacturing network provides agility in supply chain management and mitigates geopolitical risks by offering alternative production locations. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6]
*   **Commitment to Quality & Sustainability:** Extensive ISO certifications (9001, 13485, 14001, IATF 16949 for relevant facilities) demonstrate adherence to high quality and environmental standards. Focus on eco-friendly materials and renewable energy further enhances reputation and appeals to environmentally conscious customers. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 16, 47]
