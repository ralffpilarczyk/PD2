## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated) - Comprehensive Analysis

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's consolidated financial performance for FY2023, FY2024, and the four most recent interim periods reveals a company in strategic transition. The Group's late FY2024 decision to cease its supply chain management services segment significantly impacts consolidated figures, necessitating re-presentation of prior period financials to separate continuing and discontinued operations. This analysis focuses on the underlying operational health of the continuing business, incorporating both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

*Note on Interim Data: 1H figures are derived from FY total minus 2H figures. Discrepancies exist between audited Annual Report (AR) and unaudited Financial Statements (FS) for full-year discontinued operations net loss (AR: S\$3,260k vs FS: S\$2,672k), indicating re-presentation complexities and potential year-end adjustments.*

**Analysis of Financial Performance:**

Fu Yu's strategic transformation, focusing on "high-precision manufacturing," is evident in the **continuing operations**. Revenue from this core segment grew by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, driven by higher order volumes and new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments (AR p.6). Geographically, Singapore and Malaysia operations saw significant sales improvements (20.9% and 24.9% respectively), offsetting an 11.8% decline in China due to a "slower-than-expected recovery" (AR p.8), indicating a successful market shift and diversification.

Profitability in the continuing operations has sharply improved. Gross Profit Margin rose from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024, indicating improved efficiency. More strikingly, **EBITDA from continuing operations surged over 14-fold from S$0.6 million in FY2023 to S$8.5 million in FY2024**, demonstrating a significant turnaround in core operational profitability. The net loss from continuing operations narrowed from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to just S$1.2 million in FY2024. Management highlights that excluding a one-off non-cash impairment of S$0.6 million, this loss would have been even lower at S$0.6 million (AR p.6), underscoring the underlying positive trend.

The narrative of "a company in transition" is strongly defined by the cessation of the supply chain management services segment. This segment contributed a declining 39.9% of total revenue in FY2024 and recorded an increasing net loss (S$2.5 million in FY2023 to S$3.3 million in FY2024, AR p.143). Critically, this segment has been subject to an **ongoing investigation** into "significant weaknesses within FYSCS's risk management process," "unverifiable arrangements," and "unauthorized usage of the email account" (AR p.7, p.104). The auditor has issued a **qualified opinion** due to inability to determine the full financial impact of this investigation (AR p.104), casting a shadow over past consolidated figures and future legal exposures. A S$3.3 million goodwill impairment in FY2024 is directly linked to the cessation of this troubled segment (AR p.142).

From a broader financial health perspective, the Group generated **net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024**, a significant reversal from an S$4.5 million outflow in FY2023 (AR p.6), indicating improved operational liquidity. The balance sheet remains healthy, with net cash of S$55.5 million (7.3 cents/share, AR p.6), providing a strong buffer for strategic investments, including S$6.9 million in capital expenditure (AR p.9).

In conclusion, Fu Yu's core manufacturing business shows a clear positive trajectory despite a consolidated net loss, marked by revenue growth, margin improvement, and strong operational profitability. The ongoing investigation and qualified audit opinion related to the discontinued supply chain segment remain a significant legacy issue requiring close monitoring, yet appear isolated from the improving fundamentals of the continuing manufacturing operations. Management's forward-looking statements of a 20% year-on-year increase in the order book for FY2025 (AR p.7) underpin optimism for the core business.
