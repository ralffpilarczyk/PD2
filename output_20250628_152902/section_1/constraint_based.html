**Section 1: Operating Footprint**

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") maintains a diversified operational footprint focused on high-precision manufacturing across Asia, supported by strategic investments in physical and human capital. As of December 31, 2024, the Group's workforce comprised 1,372 employees, a decrease from 1,488 in 2023 and 1,535 in 2022 [1]. This reduction reflects a streamlined operational focus after discontinuing its supply chain management services.

The Group operates six strategic manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, encompassing over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity [2]. Its flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, with over 9,348 square meters of usable space, is a cornerstone of its advanced manufacturing capabilities. This facility features a 100K-class cleanroom vital for biomedical product manufacturing and boasts high-precision tooling and 3D metal printing capabilities [3]. Investments in operational assets in FY2024 totaled S$6.9 million, primarily for factory equipment, plant, and machinery, compared to S$3.962 million in FY2023 [4]. This includes the ongoing replacement of hydraulic machinery with energy-efficient electric alternatives and installation of solar panels across facilities in Singapore (completed FY2024), Johor (operational Q4 FY2024), and Penang (operational Q2 FY2025), aiming to generate up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy [5].

The Group's geographic revenue composition from its continuing manufacturing operations shifted in FY2024, aligning with a strategy to mitigate geopolitical risks by offering production flexibility [6].

| Geographic Revenue (S$ million) | FY2024 | FY2023 | 2H2024 | 2H2023 | 1H2024 | 1H2023 |
|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Singapore                       | 46.2   | 38.2   | 25.2   | 18.5   | 21.0   | 19.7   |
| Malaysia                        | 36.6   | 29.3   | 18.8   | 16.5   | 17.8   | 12.8   |
| China                           | 32.1   | 36.4   | 16.1   | 16.3   | 16.0   | 20.1   |
| **Total Manufacturing**         | **114.9** | **103.9** | **60.1** | **51.3** | **54.8** | **52.6** |

This shift indicates increased revenue contribution from Singapore (40.2% in FY2024 vs. 36.8% in FY2023) and Malaysia (31.9% in FY2024 vs. 28.2% in FY2023), while China's contribution decreased (27.9% in FY2024 vs. 35.0% in FY2023) [7]. A significant change in the operating footprint was the cessation of all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd in the last quarter of FY2024, enabling resource reallocation to the core manufacturing business [8]. The operational structure, enhanced by an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform and increasing automation, supports competitive positioning by reducing downtime and enabling high-precision production at the 5-micron level [9]. This focus on advanced capabilities and geographical flexibility is integral to the Group's strategy for long-term sustainable revenue and growth [10].
