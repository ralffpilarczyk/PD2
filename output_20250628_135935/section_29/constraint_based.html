Section 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's operating performance over the last 24 months reveals a mixed picture. While revenue growth has been modest, improvements in gross profit margin and a significant turnaround in profitability from continuing operations are positive indicators.  However, the discontinuation of the supply chain management segment and ongoing investigations into its past affairs warrant close scrutiny. The following three key operating metrics, chosen for their material impact on Fu Yu's economic performance, provide further insight.


**Metric 1:  Unit Pricing of High-Precision Products**

* **Definition and Relevance:** This metric tracks the average price per unit of high-precision plastic and metal components and products, reflecting the company's ability to command premium pricing for its specialized manufacturing expertise.  Higher unit pricing directly translates to higher revenue and profitability.
* **Historical Data:**  The provided annual report lacks quarterly data on unit pricing. However, the report states that FY2024 revenue from continuing operations (manufacturing) grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million from S$103.9 million in FY2023. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, FY2024 Financial Performance]  Further information on unit pricing changes within this period is needed to understand the drivers of this revenue growth.
* **Benchmarking:**  Benchmarking against key competitors requires data on their unit pricing, which is not provided. Industry average data for high-precision manufacturing in the life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive and industrial sectors would also be beneficial for a comparative analysis.
* **Performance Drivers:**  The 10.5% revenue increase in FY2024 could be attributed to successful new product introductions (NPIs) and improved customer acquisition.  [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, FY2024 Financial Performance].  However, more granular data is necessary to ascertain whether this growth stemmed from increased volume or higher unit pricing.
* **Sustainability of Trend:**  The sustainability of the current unit pricing trend depends on maintaining Fu Yu's competitive advantage in precision engineering, including technological advancements and strong customer relationships.  The impact of macroeconomic factors like inflation and competitor actions also need to be considered.
* **Financial Impact:**  Higher unit pricing directly contributes to revenue growth and margin expansion.  The exact contribution requires more detailed data.
* **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What were the average unit prices for Fu Yu's high-precision products in each quarter of the last 24 months, broken down by product category?
    2. How has Fu Yu's unit pricing changed relative to key competitors and industry averages over the same period?


**Metric 2: Customer Retention Rate (High-Precision Segment)**

* **Definition and Relevance:** This measures the percentage of high-precision manufacturing customers retained over a specific period.  High retention indicates strong customer loyalty and reduces customer acquisition costs.
* **Historical Data:**  The annual report does not provide data on customer retention rates, only mentioning that "the order book at the end of FY2024 has increased 20% year-on-year." [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Conclusion and Outlook].  This is indirect evidence, at best.
* **Benchmarking:**  Benchmarking against competitors or industry averages is not possible without specific customer retention rate data for Fu Yu and its competitors.
* **Performance Drivers:**  Factors such as product quality, customer service, and competitive pricing influence retention rates. The annual report mentions efforts to enhance value add and build partnerships. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Company Profile].
* **Sustainability of Trend:**  Sustaining high retention rates requires continued investment in quality control, customer relationship management, and product innovation.  External factors like competitive pressure and economic downturns could negatively affect retention.
* **Financial Impact:**  Higher retention reduces customer acquisition costs, thereby boosting profitability.  The quantitative impact is unknown without specific data.
* **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1. What has been Fu Yu's customer retention rate for its high-precision manufacturing segment on a quarterly basis over the past 24 months?
    2. How does Fu Yu's retention rate compare to its key competitors in the high-precision market?


**Metric 3:  Customer Acquisition Cost (High-Precision Segment)**

* **Definition and Relevance:** This metric measures the total cost of acquiring a new high-precision manufacturing customer.  Lower costs indicate greater efficiency in sales and marketing efforts.
* **Historical Data:** The provided documents do not contain any data regarding customer acquisition costs for the past 24 months.
* **Benchmarking:** Without data on Fu Yu's CAC and industry benchmarks, a comparative analysis is impossible.
* **Performance Drivers:**  The success of Fu Yu's NPI team and its marketing efforts affect the CAC. [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Chairman's Message].  However, the specific impact requires further data.
* **Sustainability of Trend:**  Maintaining a low CAC requires consistent sales and marketing effectiveness, a strong brand reputation, and a focused approach to targeting prospective customers.  Increased competition may drive up acquisition costs.
* **Financial Impact:** Lower CAC directly translates to increased profitability by reducing the cost of revenue. The specific monetary impact requires detailed data analysis.
* **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1. What has been Fu Yu's customer acquisition cost (CAC) for its high-precision manufacturing segment on a quarterly basis for the past 24 months, broken down by marketing channel?
    2. How does Fu Yu’s CAC compare to industry benchmarks and its key competitors’ CAC in the high-precision market?
