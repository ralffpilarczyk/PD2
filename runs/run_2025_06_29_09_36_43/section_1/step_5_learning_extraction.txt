ANALYTICAL_INSTRUCTIONS:
- instruction: "When a manufacturing site is liquidated or added, investigate the specific reasons, its prior or planned scale (revenue/assets/employees), and the financial impact (e.g., impairment, capital expenditure) – lack of such detail precludes a full assessment of operational success or failure."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When analyzing stated production capacity alongside significant capital investments or expected demand increases (e.g., order book growth), cross-reference these trends. Critically investigate whether the stated capacity reflects total vs. usable capacity and demand specific capacity utilization rates and potential bottlenecks – static capacity amidst growth or investment is a critical red flag indicating potential future constraints."

- instruction: "When reviewing key operational assets, analyze the breakdown of owned versus leased assets, especially noting any significant changes in right-of-use assets – this is crucial for assessing capital intensity, long-term control over operations, and strategic flexibility."

- instruction: "When analyzing human resource metrics (headcount, new hires, turnover rates), always scrutinize reclassifications of worker categories (e.g., outsourced vs. permanent) – assess their material impact on comparability of historical data, the true total workforce utilized, and potential shifts in financial line items (e.g., labor costs shifting to contract services)."

- instruction: "When analyzing human resources, always seek or request employee distribution by functional area – this provides critical insight into the strategic allocation of resources, potential operational bottlenecks within specific departments, and the alignment of cost structure with business objectives."

  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When analyzing workforce training metrics, specifically compare trends in total training hours against stated strategic shifts (e.g., adoption of automation, Industry 4.0 advancements) – a decline in training hours amidst a push for technological advancement is a significant red flag indicating potential skills gaps and a contradiction of management narrative."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "When assessing operational efficiency and competitive positioning, identify and proactively seek key missing operational metrics such as Capacity Utilization Rate, Throughput/Output (Units/Volume), Quality/Defect Rates, Employee Productivity (e.g., Revenue/Employee), Customer Retention Rate, and relevant Industry Benchmarks – the consistent absence of these metrics fundamentally limits the ability to gauge performance and effectiveness of strategic initiatives."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "When a significant business line or operation is ceased, quantify its previous scale (e.g., revenue contribution, associated assets, employees impacted) and assess the true underlying reasons beyond stated narratives – abrupt cessation often implies severe unstated issues (e.g., governance concerns, unprofitability, operational failure) requiring deeper investigation into its comprehensive impact."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When analyzing efficiency improvement claims (e.g., 'aims to reduce downtime by X%'), always demand baseline figures for the metric being improved – without a quantifiable baseline, the actual impact and effectiveness of investments cannot be objectively assessed, making the claims unsubstantiated."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When analyzing sustainability initiatives (e.g., renewable energy integration), quantify the direct financial benefits (e.g., cost savings from reduced electricity purchases, waste disposal cost reductions) in addition to their environmental impacts – this provides a more holistic assessment of the business case and return on investment."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When assessing digital transformation initiatives (e.g., ERP implementation), move beyond generic statements by demanding specific expected benefits (e.g., inventory optimization, forecasting accuracy improvements, cycle time reduction) and the current status/maturity of implementation – this enables assessment of tangible impact rather than vague promises."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When analyzing significant geographic shifts in revenue contribution or operational presence, identify and assess the new operational challenges introduced (e.g., establishing new supplier networks, adapting to different regulatory environments, workforce re-skilling) and clarify the long-term strategic plan for any declining regions – shifts introduce new complexities beyond just mitigating risks."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When assessing strategic shifts towards higher-value or higher-margin products/sectors, seek direct evidence of this translating into actual financial performance, such as increased gross margins on specific product lines, improved average selling prices, or verifiable overall group profitability improvement – strategic intent must be validated by financial outcome."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 9
- instruction: "When evaluating order book growth, analyze its quality by considering factors such as customer concentration, margin mix of new orders, and alignment with strategic higher-value segments – mere growth in order volume does not guarantee profitability or sustainable competitive advantage without this qualitative assessment."
  section_number: 1
  quality_score: 10
- instruction: "When evaluating competitive positioning within the operating footprint, actively seek and integrate analysis of the competitive landscape and relevant industry benchmarks – these are essential external contexts for gauging relative performance, market share, and the actual effectiveness of strategic moves."
