        *   **Diversified supplier base (existing capability):** Actively diversifying global suppliers to fortify supply chain resilience. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 34, TCFD]
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:**
        *   **Competitive Context:** Amid geopolitical uncertainties (e.g., US-China trade tensions, customers seeking production away from China), this strategy offers a compelling alternative, positioning Fu Yu as a trusted partner that can navigate complex global supply chains. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, e.g., Chairman's Message on geopolitical landscape; Page 98, Risk Management Report]
        *   **Historical Context:** Revenue contribution by location will "continue to evolve over the next few years." While China operations saw a decline in revenue contribution in FY2024, Singapore and Malaysia gained market share, indicating an ongoing shift. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 4, Chairman's Message; Page 5, Chairman's Message]

3.  **Cost Containment and Operational Optimization:**
    *   **Strategy:** Actively manage and reduce operational expenses through disciplined spending, energy efficiency, and waste reduction across existing facilities.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**
        *   **Disciplined financial management systems and practices (existing capability):** Demonstrated by significant decrease in selling and administrative expenses (20.4% in FY2024). [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, Financial Highlights]
        *   **Integrated energy management systems and energy-efficient infrastructure (existing capability):** Includes energy-efficient LED light fixtures, optimized production planning, and use of frequency conversion air compressors. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 38, Energy Consumption]

        *   **Annual vendor evaluation assessments (existing capability):** To enhance environmental sustainability and cost reduction in supply chain. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 46, Environmental-friendly Supply Chain]
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:**
        *   **Competitive Context:** In a challenging operating landscape and inflationary environment, this strategy is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and improving profitability by controlling costs. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, e.g., Chairman's Message on economic conditions; Page 7, Management Discussion & Analysis]
        *   **Historical Context:** Contributed to a sharp narrowing of net loss from continuing operations in FY2024 (from S$7.6 million to S$1.2 million) and a significant increase in EBITDA (from S$0.6 million to S$8.5 million). The decline in selling and administrative expenses was "mainly due to lower expenses relating to employee costs, travelling expenses, water and electricity charges and sundry expenses." [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 8, Financial Highlights]

### Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

1.  **Feasibility of "Moving Up the Value Chain" vs. Stated Capabilities:** While the objective is to move to *even higher* precision levels, the detailed strategies primarily describe *existing* high-precision capabilities (Smart Factory, 5-micron stabilization). The actual *leap* to "even higher levels" might require significant *new* R&D or capital investment that isn't fully categorized as "existing assets/capabilities" within the strict definition of corporate strategy. The language used, "stabilising high-precision products... and *moving up* the value chain," indicates an ongoing aspiration rather than a fully achieved and currently competing-on capability for "even higher" levels. This suggests a potential gap between current *operational execution* and future *aspirational positioning*.
2.  **Impact of FYSCS Discontinuation and Investigation on Resource Allocation and Focus:** The objective of enhancing overall operational efficiency and automation faces a significant challenge from the discontinuation of the Supply Chain Management Services Segment (FYSCS) due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" and "significant weaknesses" in its risk management process, leading to an ongoing investigation and qualified audit opinion. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, Chairman's Message; Page 98, Risk Management Report; Page 104, Independent Auditor's Report; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 15, Note 15]
    *   **Challenge:** While the stated strategy is to "reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business" and sharpen focus, the investigation itself represents a major drain on management attention, legal resources, and reputation. The audit's qualified opinion for FY2024 explicitly states it was "unable to determine the potential financial impact" of the FYSCS investigation. [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 104, Independent Auditor's Report]
    *   **Disconnect:** The optimistic claim that the "ongoing inquiry is isolated only to FYSCS, and does not impact core manufacturing operations" [Source: Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 29, Section 10] appears to downplay the potential indirect impact. A large-scale internal investigation, especially one leading to a qualified audit opinion and potential legal claims (US$2.98 million pre-paid commission, US$1.24 million claim won by Evertree), inherently impacts management's bandwidth, overall corporate governance perception, and potentially the cost of capital, diverting focus and resources that could otherwise be dedicated to core manufacturing growth and efficiency objectives. It also highlights a *past capability deficiency* in risk management that casts doubt on the *current effectiveness* of internal controls. The Board itself states, "the internal controls and risk management systems of the Supply Chain Management Segment *may be inadequate*." [Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 99, Principle 9]
