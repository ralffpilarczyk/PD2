## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

**Overview:**
Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") is a Singapore-headquartered precision plastic and metal components manufacturer, operating a vertically-integrated business model across six strategic manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China. With over 1.5 million square feet of production capacity, this diversified footprint supports its one-stop solution strategy and adaptation to global supply chain dynamics.

However, recent significant operational changes, particularly the cessation of the supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) amidst serious internal control failures and an ongoing investigation, cast a critical light on the Group's actual operational stability and strategic execution. This discontinuation, rooted in severe governance issues rather than merely a "strategic discontinuation" as initially presented by management, fundamentally questions overall management trustworthiness and internal controls, thus impacting the interpretation of all subsequent strategic claims regarding the Group's increased focus on high-precision manufacturing in Singapore and Malaysia.

### a. Geographic Footprint and Main Operating Assets

The Group's wholly-owned subsidiaries operate across three key Asian countries, providing geographical flexibility and supporting its international customer base.

**Key Operating Sites & Strategic Importance:**
The Group's six manufacturing sites are strategically located:
*   **Singapore:** The advanced Smart Factory, with 100K-class cleanroom facilities and over 9,348 sqm of usable space, focuses on high-precision tooling and manufacturing. This site is crucial for high-value products in life sciences, medical, and automotive sectors, aligning with the Group's strategic shift.
*   **Malaysia (Johor and Penang):** These sites support a broader range of manufacturing activities, offering cost-effectiveness and an alternative production base, which aligns with customer demands for supply chain diversification.
*   **China (Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen):** These locations continue to provide significant manufacturing capacity, though the Group is strategically re-aligning its revenue contribution away from this region.

**Ownership of Key Assets:**
As of 31 December 2024, the Group's Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) had a carrying amount of S$58.603 million, with a significant portion being owned, providing direct control over core manufacturing infrastructure. Some leasehold properties also support operations, and investment property (leased to third parties) had a carrying amount of S$5.842 million.

**Critical Data Gap:** The provided documents lack specific historical operational data on square footage or distinct capacity metrics *per site* (e.g., number of machines, cleanroom sizes by location), and the breakdown of PPE value by geographical location for the last three years. This absence significantly hampers the ability to assess:
*   If capital allocation genuinely aligns with the stated strategic shift towards high-precision manufacturing in Singapore and Malaysia.
*   If significant underutilized capacity exists in regions like China, especially given the static total capacity and strategic re-alignment of revenue away from China.

*Note: Historical data for employee distribution by category (management levels) and interim period data is not disclosed in the provided documents.*

The overall headcount has significantly decreased across all regions, including strategically important Singapore and Malaysia. While the FYSCS closure accounted for 131 temporary staff, this universal decline in headcount warrants deeper scrutiny, especially given the stated strategic shift towards higher-value manufacturing in these key regions. It raises critical questions:
*   Does this reduction reflect successful automation and efficiency improvements (a positive indicator)?
*   Or does it signify a broader contraction in overall manufacturing volume (a negative indicator)?
*   Are there underlying challenges in talent attraction or retention?

Without data on revenue or output per employee trends, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, it is difficult to definitively discern if the reduction signifies enhanced productivity or a shrinking operational scale.

### c. Key Operational Data Points and Scale

**Production Capacity & Scale:**

| Data Point                         | FY2024 Value    | Unit            | FY2023 Value* | FY2022 Value* | Date/Period | Source                                       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Total Production Floor Capacity    | >1.5            | million sq ft   | >1.5          | >1.5          | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"     |
| Singapore Smart Factory Usable Space | >9,348          | sqm             | -             | -             | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"  |
| Singapore Smart Factory Cleanroom Class | 100K            | class           | 100K          | 100K          | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, p.5                   |
| Total Solar Energy Generation Capacity | Up to 3,233     | MWh             | -             | -             | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"  |
| Product Precision Level            | 5               | micron          | 5             | 5             | As at FY    | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"  |
*Note: Unless specifically stated, historical values for these operational metrics beyond FY2024 were not explicitly detailed in the provided documents, though some general capacity/precision levels are likely consistent across years.*

The total production floor capacity has remained constant at >1.5 million sq ft over three years. This, combined with the explicit strategic shift of revenue away from China, strongly suggests uneven utilization rates across regions. Specifically:
*   **Potential underutilization in China:** Assets in China may be underutilized, potentially acting as a drag on returns.
*   **Capacity limits in Singapore/Malaysia:** Singapore and Malaysia facilities may be operating at or nearing their capacity limits, potentially constraining growth in these strategic areas.

**Critical Data Gap:** The absence of historical data for key investments (e.g., Singapore Smart Factory usable space, solar energy generation capacity) hinders the ability to track the pace and scale of these strategic initiatives and verify their impact over time.

**Customer Data:**

| Data Point                                | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Q4 FY2024 | Q3 FY2024 | Q2 FY2024 | Q1 FY2024 | Unit      | Source                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Customers contributing >10% of Group Revenue | 3      | 1      | 1      | N/A       | N/A       | N/A       | N/A       | # customers | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.138, "Concentration of revenue" |
*Note: Interim period data for customer concentration is not disclosed in the provided documents.*

Crucially, the three customers contributing >10% of Group revenue in FY2024 were *all* from the discontinued supply chain management services segment. This reveals that the Group's *core manufacturing business* has a highly diversified customer base, effectively mitigating customer concentration risk – a significant operational strength that contradicts a superficial reading of the headline figure.

### d. Significant Changes and Trends in Operating Footprint

**1. Discontinuation of Supply Chain Management Services (FYSCS):**
The Group ceased all business activities in its supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) in the last quarter of FY2024. While management commentary attributed this cessation to an "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business," financial disclosures and the auditor's qualified opinion paint a starkly different and more concerning picture. An internal audit in July 2024 highlighted "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management, including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," and "irregular expense claims." An ongoing investigation with external legal and accounting firms (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd) is in progress, with claims intended against "certain persons" related to misuse of resources and prepaid commissions. This indicates a profound governance and internal control failure, rather than merely a leadership gap or strategic pivot, posing material financial and reputational risks. Such a critical internal control breakdown raises fundamental questions about management's transparency and the reliability of broader operational oversight.

Ltd."; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.26, "Discontinued Operations".

**2. Geographical Revenue Re-alignment (Manufacturing Segment):**
The Group is actively shifting its manufacturing revenue away from China, demonstrating execution on its strategy to offer geographical flexibility amidst geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain shifts.

| Revenue Contribution (Manufacturing) | FY2024 (%) | FY2023 (%) | Change (ppt) | Trend   | Date/Period       | Source                                   |
|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Singapore                            | 40.2%      | 36.8%      | +3.4         | Increase | FY2024 vs FY2023  | Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance" |
| Malaysia                             | 31.9%      | 28.2%      | +3.7         | Increase | FY2024 vs FY2023  | Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance" |
| China                                | 27.9%      | 35.0%      | -7.1         | Decrease | FY2024 vs FY2023  | Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance" |
*Note: The provided financial statements (Q424) offer this geographical revenue breakdown annually for the manufacturing segment, but do not provide these percentages for individual interim periods (Q1, Q2, Q3) within FY2024.*

This observed shift is a positive confirmation of strategic execution, enhancing supply chain resilience and reducing reliance on a single region. However, the profitability implications (e.g., higher or lower margins in Singapore/Malaysia compared to China) are not disclosed, which is crucial for assessing the overall financial impact of this strategic re-alignment.

**3. Employee Headcount & Turnover Trends:**
Overall employee numbers have decreased over the last three years. While new hire rates were very high in FY2022 and FY2023 (likely reflecting high churn or expansion), they significantly reduced in FY2024. Concurrently, turnover rates, while still notable, have also decreased in FY2024, which could indicate a period of stabilization after prior volatility. Management aims to maintain turnover (excluding temporary workers) below 30% going forward.
<sup>4</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.49, "Employment"; p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate".

| Employee Movement | FY2024   | FY2023   | FY2022   | Unit | Date/Period | Source                                         |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| New Hires         | 366      | 903      | 883      | #    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.49, "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate" |
| New Hire Rate     | 26.7%    | 60.7%    | 57.4%    | %    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.49, "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate" |
| Turnover          | 342      | 949      | 918      | #    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate" |
| Turnover Rate     | 24.9%    | 63.8%    | 59.7%    | %    | FY          | Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate" |
*Note: Interim period data for new hires and turnover is not disclosed in the provided documents.*

The significant drop in both new hires and turnover in FY2024 suggests a stabilization of the workforce and potentially improved retention, aligning with management's aim to maintain turnover (excluding temporary workers) below 30%. However, the persistent overall headcount reduction across all regions, despite strategic focus on certain areas, warrants deeper scrutiny. As noted previously (Section 1.b), it remains unclear if this reflects successful automation driving higher output per employee, is primarily attributable to the FYSCS segment discontinuation, or indicates a broader contraction in overall business activity.

**4. Investments in Technology and Sustainability:**
The Group continues to invest in its Smart Factory (e.g., ERP system, automation tools for overnight production, 3D printing for rapid prototyping, which reduced toolroom downtime by 40%) and renewable energy (solar panels across Singapore, Johor, and Penang facilities, with up to 3,233 MWh generation capacity). These efforts aim to enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and lower carbon emissions.
<sup>5</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.31, "Increasing energy prices", p.47, "Renewable Energy".

While these are positive strategic investments aligned with Industry 4.0 and ESG demands, the analysis lacks specific Capital Expenditure (CapEx) figures for these investments and quantifiable financial impact beyond the reported 40% toolroom downtime reduction. Without data on specific energy cost savings, impact on overall operational expenditure, or gross margins, it is challenging to assess the true return on investment and the scale of impact from these initiatives.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The Group's operating footprint is strategically designed to enhance its competitive positioning through several key aspects. However, the realization of these advantages is critically tied to addressing the internal control weaknesses and demonstrating clearer operational efficiencies.

1.  **Vertical Integration and One-Stop Solution:** By offering product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing, Fu Yu provides comprehensive, one-stop manufacturing services. This integration increases value-add for customers, fosters long-term partnerships, and differentiates it from less integrated competitors, promoting stronger customer retention.
    <sup>6</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.18, "Our Business".
2.  **Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities:** The Singapore Smart Factory, with its high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, and 100K-class cleanroom, positions Fu Yu at the forefront of advanced manufacturing. This enables the Group to target high-margin sectors like life sciences, medical, and automotive, supporting its strategic shift towards higher-value products. The ability to stabilize 5-micron precision products further enhances this capability.
    <sup>7</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE".
3.  **Geographical Flexibility & Supply Chain Resilience:** Operating in Singapore, Malaysia, and China allows the Group to offer geographical diversification in a volatile geopolitical environment. This flexibility is critical as customers seek to de-risk their supply chains away from a single country of origin, particularly China. The demonstrated strategic shift of revenue contribution towards Singapore and Malaysia reflects this adaptation and enhances resilience.
    <sup>8</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, p.30, "Review of performance".
4.  **Operational Efficiency and Sustainability:** Investments in Industry 4.0 machinery, automation (reducing toolroom downtime by 40%), and an integrated cloud-based ERP platform aim to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance quality. The adoption of solar energy and focus on eco-friendly materials (e.g., biodegradable bio-resin) caters to growing customer demand for sustainable products and contributes to a "greener, more responsible footprint," which can also improve access to capital.
    <sup>9</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.32, "Shift in customer preferences"; p.35, "Innovation in sustainable technologies", p.37, "Renewable energy integration"; p.47, "Our Initiatives".
5.  **Focus on New Product Introduction (NPI):** The NPI team's role in the early stages of the business cycle helps secure new projects in higher-margin categories, building customer confidence and ensuring long-term revenue streams. The increased order book (+20% YoY) is an early indicator of success from this strategy.
    <sup>10</sup> Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; p.6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE".

While these competitive advantages are conceptually sound and support Fu Yu's strategic direction, their full realization is contingent on the Group effectively addressing the severe internal control weaknesses exposed by the FYSCS investigation. Furthermore, the analysis's ability to fully verify efficiency gains, asset utilization, and quantified differentiation from competitors is limited by the absence of granular, historical per-site operational data (as noted in 1.a and 1.c) and comprehensive quantitative impact metrics for strategic investments (1.d.4). The overall headcount reduction across all regions (1.b), despite strategic growth areas, also requires clearer reconciliation with productivity gains to fully assess the operating structure's efficiency and impact on competitive positioning.
