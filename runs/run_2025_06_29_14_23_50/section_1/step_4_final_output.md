## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or "the Group") is a Singapore-listed manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components, established in 1978. It offers vertically-integrated services across diverse sectors from its Singapore, Malaysia, and China footprint.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions: Questioning Workforce Trajectories

Fu Yu's reported headcount decline (1,535 in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024) is **fundamentally compromised by a critical data incomparability**. The FY2024 figure *explicitly excludes* outsourced workers, unlike prior periods, preventing a like-for-like analysis of true workforce trajectory. Separately, average training hours per employee decreased from 16 (FY2023) to 13.2 (FY2024), attributed to "training budget control." This reduction, alongside uncertain headcount, poses a non-financial risk to long-term skill development and talent retention in a precision industry highly reliant on skilled labor.

*Note: FY2022 and FY2023 Group Total headcount includes outsourced workers; FY2024 Group Total explicitly excludes them, thus hindering direct year-on-year comparison of underlying permanent workforce size.*

### b. Main Operating Assets, Strategic Importance, and Ownership Structure

Fu Yu operates six manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, including the Singapore Smart Factory with specialized capabilities (e.g., 100K-class cleanroom, high precision tooling, 3D metal printing). As of FY2024, property, plant and equipment (PPE) totaled S$58.603 million, but **a substantial 71.3% (S$41.764 million) comprises leased properties/right-of-use assets**, not outright ownership. This high reliance imposes long-term lease liabilities and can limit customization, redevelopment, or collateralization, potentially conflicting with its stated goal of significant investment in advanced manufacturing which often necessitates deep, long-term asset-specific modifications and control.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Strategic Pivot

Fu Yu's multi-country presence supports its business strategy. Revenue data shows a clear strategic pivot: Singapore and Malaysia's manufacturing contributions increased while China's declined from 41.0% (FY2022) to 27.9% (FY2024), aligning with management's narrative of customers diversifying supply chains away from China due to geopolitical tensions. However, a **critical gap is the lack of regional profitability or margin data**. Without this, the ultimate financial efficacy of this strategic shift remains unquantified, hindering a full assessment of its benefit.

### d. Significant Changes and Trends: A Qualified Opinion Raises Governance Concerns

The most significant change in FY2024 was the cessation of all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS), overshadowed by an **ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs, which revealed "significant weaknesses" in its risk management**. This culminated in the **auditor issuing a qualified opinion on the financial statements**, unable to determine the potential financial impact of this investigation and alleged misuse of resources. This is a **major financial reporting red flag and severe governance issue**, casting material doubt on the entire financial statements' reliability and indicating potential systemic internal control weaknesses beyond FYSCS. The unknown financial magnitude of FYSCS further exacerbates uncertainty, and planned 'claims against certain persons' suggest potential for prolonged, costly legal battles. Other trends, such as the geographic pivot and continued investment in advanced manufacturing, are secondary to these severe governance concerns.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu's operating structure supports its competitive positioning through a vertically-integrated, one-stop solution model that fosters long-term partnerships. Its advanced manufacturing capabilities (e.g., Singapore Smart Factory) enable targeting high-growth, high-margin sectors. Geographic flexibility and de-risking appeal to customers diversifying supply chains. A focus on high-precision and New Product Introduction (NPI) attracts higher-value projects, and sustainability initiatives further enhance its market appeal.

Overall, Fu Yu's operating footprint demonstrates strategic adaptation via geographic diversification and advanced technological capabilities. However, these strengths are significantly overshadowed by the FYSCS investigation and qualified audit opinion, which fundamentally undermine confidence in the Group's internal controls and financial reporting reliability. Lack of granular data on workforce comparability and regional profitability further limits comprehensive assessment.
