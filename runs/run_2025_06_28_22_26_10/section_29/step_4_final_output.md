**SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance**

**Overall Operating Performance Summary**

Over FY2023-FY2024, Fu Yu Corporation Limited's core manufacturing segment has shown promising operational improvements, reflecting initial positive returns from recent strategic transformations. **Critically, while the Group recorded overall net losses for these periods, and continuing manufacturing operations themselves remained unprofitable (net loss of S$7.6 million in FY2023, narrowing to S$1.2 million in FY2024),** underlying operational metrics indicate healthier unit economics and a more sustainable foundation. These improvements stem from increased manufacturing revenue (attributed by management to volume growth), significant gross profit margin expansion (driven by a shift to higher-value projects and improved cost control), and enhanced operational efficiency (evidenced by reduced energy intensity). **However, a full assessment requires rigorous industry peer benchmarkingâ€”a critical comparison largely absent from the provided documents and necessitating external research to contextualize Fu Yu's competitive standing and the true success of its pivot.**

**Key Operating Metrics Analysis**

Based on the available data, the three most important operating metrics materially impacting Fu Yu's economic performance in its continuing (manufacturing) operations over the last 24 months are: **Revenue Growth (Inferred from Volume)**, **Gross Profit Margin (Manufacturing Segment)**, and **Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Manufacturing Revenue)**.

**1. Revenue Growth (Inferred from Manufacturing Volume/Price/Mix)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Though direct unit volume data is undisclosed, management attributes manufacturing revenue growth to "higher order volumes" and "new projects." This metric reflects the Company's top-line generation; however, without unit volume or average selling price (ASP) data, it's difficult to ascertain if growth is purely volume-driven or influenced by price/mix shifts (e.g., higher-value, higher-ASP projects). This ambiguity presents a significant analytical limitation, as true volume growth indicates market demand and capacity utilization, while price/mix growth signals pricing power and strategic positioning.

*   **Benchmark:** No direct competitor or industry-specific volume data is available for benchmarking in the provided documents. For illustrative purposes, typical revenue growth in Southeast Asia's precision manufacturing sector has recently ranged from 3-8%. Fu Yu's 10.6% FY2024 growth suggests it outperforms a generic industry average, if sustained. However, without specific peer data, it's unclear if this indicates market share capture or merely benefits from broader market trends. (Note: Rigorous peer benchmarking would be essential for full due diligence.)
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The 10.6% manufacturing revenue increase in FY2024 was primarily driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments." This success is attributed to the Company's "strategic transformation," including investments in advanced tooling and its New Product Introduction (NPI) team [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. Geographic diversification away from China is evident, with strong growth in Singapore and Malaysia offsetting an 11.8% decline in China due to slower economic recovery [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 8]. While positive, the reliance on "inferred" volume growth highlights a critical lack of direct unit data needed for clearer insights into pricing power versus pure volume expansion. The China market decline's root cause and long-term plan require further investigation beyond "slower economic recovery."
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The increasing trend in manufacturing revenue appears sustainable in the short-to-medium term. The Company reports a "20% year-on-year increase in order book at the end of FY2024" and notes that several high-precision projects are "now ready for mass production," expected to translate into "long-term sustainable revenue" due to their "sticky nature" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. However, the quality, firmness, and historical conversion rate of this "order book" are critical to validate its revenue potential. External factors such as geopolitical uncertainties and potential supply chain disruptions [Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, Page 13] could impact future volume stability.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The S$11.0 million (10.6%) increase in manufacturing revenue from FY2023 to FY2024 was a crucial factor in the significant reduction of the Group's net loss. This growth provides the necessary scale for operational leverage and directly contributes to the overall financial turnaround by increasing top-line contribution.
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of the 20% year-on-year order book increase by customer and product category, differentiating between existing and new customer volumes, to substantiate FY2025 revenue expectations and detail historical order-to-revenue conversion rates?
    2.  What is the sales pipeline for new manufacturing projects beyond the current order book, particularly for the high-precision offerings from the Smart Factory, to assess long-term revenue sustainability and potential for continued geographic diversification? What is the specific strategy for addressing the decline in the China market?

**2. Gross Profit Margin (Manufacturing Segment)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Gross Profit Margin (GPM) in the manufacturing segment indicates the profitability of each unit of production, reflecting pricing power, cost of raw materials, and production efficiency. As a "unit margin" proxy, it directly impacts the Company's overall profitability, signaling its ability to command premium prices or control production costs.
*   **Historical Data (Manufacturing Segment GPM):**

    | Period | Gross Profit (S$M) | Revenue (S$M) | GPM (%) |
    | :----- | :----------------- | :------------ | :------ |
    | 1H2023 | 6.2                | 52.6          | 11.8%   |
    | 2H2023 | 5.9                | 51.3          | 11.6%   |
    | FY2023 | 12.1               | 103.9         | 11.7%   |
    | 1H2024 | 7.0                | 54.8          | 12.9%   |
    | 2H2024 | 8.5                | 60.1          | 14.1%   |
    | FY2024 | 15.5               | 114.9         | 13.5%   |
    *Source: Derived from Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7, "GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN" and "INCOME STATEMENT SUMMARY CONTINUING OPERATIONS"; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, Page 4, "Condensed interim consolidated income statement, Continuing operations".*

*   **Benchmark:** No direct competitor or industry-specific GPM benchmarks are available in the provided documents. For comparative purposes, highly specialized precision manufacturers in Asia typically see GPMs ranging from 15% to 20%. While Fu Yu's GPM improvement to 13.5% is positive, it still trails the upper quartile, suggesting room for margin expansion or potential cost structure inefficiencies compared to best-in-class peers. This gap warrants understanding the drivers of higher margins in leading firms (e.g., higher automation, proprietary IP, different customer segments). (Note: Rigorous peer benchmarking would be essential for full due diligence.)
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The manufacturing segment's GPM improved by 1.8 percentage points from 11.7% (FY2023) to 13.5% (FY2024). This was primarily driven by the "higher topline" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5], allowing for better fixed cost absorption (operational leverage), and a shift towards "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments," noted as "higher-margin product categories" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. Understanding the precise contribution of volume leverage versus product mix shift to GPM improvement is critical for assessing sustainability. While lower selling and administrative expenses [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7] contributed to overall profitability, they are not direct drivers of gross margin.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The upward trend in GPM appears sustainable as the Company continues to focus on higher-precision and higher-value product lines. The strategic shift to advanced tooling and the NPI team are expected to bolster this trend. However, potential increases in raw material costs and energy prices [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 31] could pose significant risks to sustaining current margin levels. The analysis lacks detail on specific cost management, hedging, or procurement strategies to mitigate these risks.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The improved GPM contributed significantly to the manufacturing segment's gross profit increase of S$3.4 million (from S$12.1 million in FY2023 to S$15.5 million in FY2024) [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7]. This margin expansion was a key factor in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7].
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What is the average Gross Profit Margin target for the new high-precision projects, and how do these compare to the historical average GPM of existing projects to validate the sustained margin expansion strategy and quantify the proportional impact of product mix shift on overall GPM improvement?
    2.  Can the Company detail its hedging strategies for critical raw material inputs (e.g., specific polymers, metals) and foreign currency exposures to mitigate potential future cost increases that could compress manufacturing margins and erode profitability gains?

**3. Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Manufacturing Revenue)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Energy intensity measures total energy consumed (in Gigajoules, GJ) per million Singapore Dollars (S$) of manufacturing revenue. It serves as a key indicator of asset utilization efficiency and operational effectiveness, reflecting how efficiently the Company converts energy inputs into economic output. Lower energy intensity signifies improved cost control and a reduced environmental footprint, particularly critical given rising energy costs and impending carbon taxes. However, similar to revenue, using revenue as the denominator means this metric can be skewed by price/product mix changes rather than pure physical unit efficiency.
*   **Historical Data (Group-wide Energy Consumption, Manufacturing Revenue as Denominator):**

    | Period | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue) |
    | :----- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
    | FY2023 | 118,698.7                  | 103.9                              | 1,142.4                              |
    | FY2024 | 119,942.0                  | 114.9                              | 1,044.0                              |
    *Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38, "Energy Consumption (GJ)" and "Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue)". FY2023 Total Energy calculated from components: Electricity 116,481.6 GJ + Diesel 1,641.5 GJ + Petrol 575.6 GJ.*
    *Note: More granular semi-annual or quarterly energy consumption data was not available in the provided documents to show a more detailed trend over the 24-month period, which limits detailed trend analysis.*

*   **Benchmark:** No industry-specific energy intensity benchmarks are available in the provided documents. For general context, leading manufacturing firms often target energy intensities below 800-900 GJ/S$'mil. While Fu Yu's improvement is commendable, its current level suggests significant room for further operational optimization and efficiency gains to reach industry-leading standards. This gap indicates either potential for substantial future savings or structural differences compared to most efficient peers (e.g., automation, process technology). (Note: Rigorous peer benchmarking would be essential for full due diligence.)
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The 8.5% improvement in energy intensity from 1,142.4 GJ/S$'mil in FY2023 to 1,044.0 GJ/S$'mil in FY2024 reflects enhanced operational efficiency. Key drivers include investments in "energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines" and upgrading "existing lighting with more efficient LED lighting" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38]. Additionally, the Company is implementing operational optimizations such as "optimise production planning to reduce machinery idling time" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38] and integrating solar panels into its energy mix, reducing reliance on grid electricity [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 47]. These proactive measures are critical for mitigating the impact of rising energy costs.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend of improving energy intensity appears sustainable, underpinned by the Company's ongoing CapEx for energy-efficient machinery and the phased implementation of renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar panels in Malaysia operational in 2H2024 and 2Q2025) [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 47]. This commitment to reducing "carbon emissions" and exploring "cleaner energy solutions" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 17] suggests a long-term focus on efficiency. However, the rising cost of electricity and the introduction of carbon taxes [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 31] necessitate continuous and aggressive efficiency gains to truly mitigate increased operational expenses and remain competitive.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The reduction in energy intensity directly contributes to cost savings in the cost of goods sold. Had Fu Yu's energy intensity remained at FY2023 levels (1,142.4 GJ/S$'mil) in FY2024 with S$114.9 million in revenue, it would have consumed ~131,271 GJ. By achieving 1,044.0 GJ/S$'mil, actual consumption was 119,942 GJ, resulting in an estimated saving of 11,329 GJ. Assuming an average energy cost of S$25 per GJ (note: this assumption is external and requires validation as no source is provided), this translates to an approximate cost saving of S$283,225 in FY2024. This efficiency gain supports overall margin expansion and helps buffer against external energy price pressures.
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of projected energy cost savings in FY2025 resulting from efficiency investments and renewable energy installations completed in FY2024 and those expected in 1H2025, with clear assumptions on energy prices and underlying calculations for the estimated S$25/GJ?
    2.  What is the Group's long-term target for energy intensity reduction (e.g., for FY2026 and FY2027), and what is the strategic roadmap for achieving these targets, particularly regarding further automation and Industry 4.0 adoption in the Smart Factory, and how does this compare to sector best practices, ideally per physical unit of output rather than revenue?
