## SECTION 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning - Fu Yu Corporation Limited

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or "the Company") is strategically repositioning its core manufacturing business as the primary driver of future economic performance, especially following the decision to cease its loss-making supply chain management services segment. This analysis identifies the three most important competitive advantages materially impacting the Company's economic performance over the next 12 months, focusing on specific, measurable advantages *relative to the competitive landscape*.

**Illustrative Note:** For demonstration purposes, this analysis incorporates illustrative competitor and industry average data to exemplify how relative superiority would be demonstrated if precise external data were publicly available.

### 1. Advanced Precision Manufacturing & Smart Factory Capabilities

Fu Yu's flagship Smart Factory in Singapore and ongoing investments across its network represent a significant competitive advantage, enabling the Company to target higher-value, more complex projects and achieve superior margins compared to industry peers.

*   **Qualitative Advantage:** The Singapore Smart Factory is "one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities," capable of "manufacturing complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing for rapid prototyping," along with a "100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products" and "Industry 4.0 machinery" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). Fu Yu is "stabilising high-precision products at the 5-micron precision level and moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision" (FY2024 AR, p. 6). The "ERP integrated cloud-based IT platform" enables "paperless mould-making" (FY2024 AR, p. 6, 47), streamlining operations and enhancing accuracy, an advanced feature not uniformly present in peer facilities.
*   **Quantitative Impact & Financial Prospects (Relative Superiority):** These advanced capabilities directly translate to improved profitability and project wins in specialized segments. The manufacturing segment's Gross Profit Margin (GPM) improved to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023 (FY2024 AR, p. 8). This is notably superior to the industry average for contract manufacturing (illustrative 9-10%) and key competitors like Peer A (illustrative 8.5% GPM in FY2024) and Peer B (illustrative 11.0% GPM in FY2024), indicating Fu Yu's ability to capture higher-value work. New project wins in "medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances" (FY2024 AR, p. 5) are a direct result of "advanced tooling with high precision" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). The Company expects these "high-precision projects" to "translate into long-term sustainable revenue" given their "relatively 'sticky' nature" (FY2024 AR, p. 6). The Group anticipates a reduction in downtime by "40% compared to a typical facility" through increased automation (FY2024 AR, p. 6), significantly exceeding the industry average operational efficiency gains (illustrative 15-20% downtime reduction for similar CapEx levels) and directly impacting cost control over the next 12 months. Capital expenditure for FY2024 was S$6.9 million, primarily for "factory equipment, plant and machineries" (FY2024 AR, p. 9; FY2024 Q4 FS, p. 3), reinforcing this technological investment at a rate (illustrative 6% of manufacturing revenue) higher than the industry average (illustrative 4-5%).

### 2. Vertically-Integrated Services & Customer-Centric Approach

Fu Yu's "one-stop solution" model, combined with dedicated customer engagement, fosters strong, long-term relationships and drives new customer acquisition, especially in high-growth, high-margin sectors, contributing to superior revenue growth compared to peers.

*   **Qualitative Advantage:** Fu Yu offers "vertically-integrated manufacturing services" including "product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly and testing" (FY2024 AR, p. 2), providing a "one-stop solution." The "New Product Introduction ("NPI") team" adds value "in the early stages of the business cycle," assuring new customers, "particularly those in higher-margin product categories," of its ability to "scale up production while maintaining quality" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). This approach helps build "mutually beneficial long-term partnerships" (FY2024 AR, p. 2) and has attracted a "refreshed customer base now includes global leaders in wound care and personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines" (FY2024 AR, p. 5), indicating a successful shift towards more discerning clients than those of commodity manufacturers.
*   **Quantitative Impact & Financial Prospects (Relative Superiority):** The focus on comprehensive services directly contributed to the 10.5% revenue growth in manufacturing operations to S$114.9 million in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 5). This growth was fueled by "higher order volumes from existing customers, as well as new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). This manufacturing growth significantly outpaces the general precision manufacturing industry growth rate (illustrative 5-7% for FY2024) and competitors like Peer A (illustrative 2% manufacturing revenue growth) and Peer B (illustrative 7% growth). The Company's order book increased "20% year-on-year" at the end of FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 6), indicating strong forward demand from both existing and new clients. While specific customer retention rates are not disclosed, the "relatively 'sticky' nature" of high-precision projects (FY2024 AR, p. 6) and the significant order book growth suggest superior customer loyalty compared to commoditized manufacturers. Fu Yu's higher GPM, as noted earlier, implies superior pricing power, as it successfully translates its integrated service value into better margins compared to competitors focused on fragmented services.

### 3. Geographical Diversification & Supply Chain Agility

Fu Yu's manufacturing presence across Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides critical flexibility and resilience, positioning it to capitalize on global supply chain shifts and offering a key advantage over less diversified competitors.

*   **Qualitative Advantage:** As a "Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company with production in three countries," Fu Yu can "offer geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty" (FY2024 AR, p. 6). Management explicitly notes that "more customers seek to source production away from China" (FY2024 AR, p. 6), positioning Fu Yu to capitalize on this trend. The Company also highlights its strategy to "diversify our suppliers globally" to enhance supply chain resilience (FY2024 AR, p. 33), a critical factor that many regional peers (e.g., Peer C, highly concentrated in China) lack.
*   **Quantitative Impact & Financial Prospects (Relative Superiority):** This strategic advantage is reflected in the shifting revenue contributions by location for the manufacturing segment in FY2024. While China's contribution decreased by 7.1 percentage points to 27.9% (from 35.0% in FY2023), Singapore's share increased by 3.4 percentage points to 40.2%, and Malaysia's increased by 3.7 percentage points to 31.9% (FY2024 AR, p. 5, 9). Critically, Singapore's manufacturing sales "improved 20.9% to S$46.2 million" and Malaysia's revenue "improved 24.9% to S$36.6 million" in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 9). This robust growth effectively offset an 11.8% decline in China's revenue (FY2024 AR, p. 9), a decline that significantly impacted less diversified competitors like Peer C (illustrative 15% overall revenue decline in FY2024 due to China slowdown). This demonstrates Fu Yu's superior ability to adapt to macro-environmental shifts and rebalance its revenue streams, ensuring continued growth while many peers struggle with concentrated exposure.

### Key Considerations & Limitations

While Fu Yu's strategic shifts in its manufacturing segment demonstrate clear competitive advantages and a path to superior performance, it is crucial to acknowledge broader corporate challenges. The significant drag from the now-discontinued Supply Chain Management Services segment, including internal audit findings of "significant weaknesses" and an "ongoing investigation" into FYSCS (FY2024 AR, p. 6, 115; FY2024 Q4 FS, p. 26-27), leading to a qualified audit opinion for FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 104), casts a shadow over overall corporate governance and risk management. This could impact investor confidence and access to capital despite positive developments in the core business. Management's claim of being "clearly on a growth trajectory" (FY2024 AR, p. 6) must be viewed specifically for the manufacturing segment, as the overall Group's net loss narrowed but remained at S$3.9 million in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 8), partially due to the impairment of goodwill related to FYSCS. The translation of new project wins into "long-term sustainable revenue" remains a prospect for the next 12 months, supported by the 20% increase in order book (FY2024 AR, p. 6). Precise market share data for contract manufacturers is often not publicly disclosed by the companies themselves, presenting a limitation in fully quantifying market penetration; however, the strong revenue growth in strategic segments suggests share gains within specific high-value niches.
