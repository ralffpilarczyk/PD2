## SECTION 13: Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies Analysis

This analysis examines Fu Yu Corporation Limited's strategic objectives and corporate strategies, distinguishing between the two. It identifies key disconnects and critically assesses management's reporting.

### A. Strategic Objectives

Strategic objectives are forward-looking goals with defined timeframes, metrics, and resource considerations.

**Top 3 Strategic Objectives:**

1.  **Elevate Precision Manufacturing & Value Chain Focus**
    *   **Objective:** Stabilize high-precision products at 5-micron and advance up the value chain for even higher precision, targeting high-margin projects in medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5-6).
    *   **Timeframe and Horizons:** Ongoing, medium-to-long-term, evidenced by continuous pursuit of "even higher levels of precision" and "long-term sustainable revenue" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Success Metrics and KPIs:** Measured by securing new projects in target industries (medical devices, drone, smart appliances), translating gestating high-precision projects into mass production, and revenue growth from high-margin segments (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Investments in Singapore Smart Factory (Industry 4.0 machinery, advanced tooling, 100K-class cleanroom) and S$6.9M FY2024 CAPEX, primarily for equipment (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3; Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5; Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8; Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 10). Establishment of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4).

2.  **Increase Operational Automation & Efficiency**
    *   **Objective:** Increase toolroom automation for continuous production (including overnight/weekend), aiming for a 40% downtime reduction (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). Supported by completion of ERP integrated cloud-based IT platform testing (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Timeframe and Horizons:** Short-to-medium-term operational improvement, increasing "from this year" (FY2025 onwards) (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Success Metrics and KPIs:** Primary metric is "40% reduction in downtime" in the toolroom (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). Implicit KPIs include improved production efficiency and cost savings.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Investment in Industry 4.0 machinery and an ERP integrated cloud-based IT platform (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5, 6), aligning with S$6.9M FY2024 CAPEX (Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8).

3.  **Enhance Environmental Sustainability (Carbon Reduction)**
    *   **Objective:** Reduce overall Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by FY2030, using FY2023 as baseline (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41).
    *   **Timeframe and Horizons:** Defined medium-term target (by FY2030) (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41).
    *   **Success Metrics and KPIs:** Direct KPI is "30% reduction in Scope 2 overall emissions" from FY2023 baseline (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41). FY2024 target was 3.0% reduction (actual 1.4%) (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 41).
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Installation of solar panels in Singapore (completed FY2024), Johor (operational Q4 FY2024), and Penang (expected Q2 FY2025), aiming for 3,233 MWh renewable energy (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5; Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 47). Progressive replacement of older hydraulic machinery with energy-efficient electric alternatives (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 32, 47). Exploration of green financing (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 35).

### B. Corporate Strategies

Corporate strategies describe how the company leverages existing assets and capabilities to compete, focusing on feasible present actions rather than future aspirations.

**Top 3 Corporate Strategies:**

1.  **Divest Non-Core Supply Chain Business to Re-focus on Core High-Precision Manufacturing**
    *   **Strategy:** Fu Yu ceased all business activities in its supply chain management arm (FYSCS) in Q4 FY2024, a concrete action to "reallocate resources to our core manufacturing business" and emphasize "high-precision manufacturing" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4-5).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Leverage existing vertically-integrated manufacturing services, 45+ years of operating knowledge in high-end precision plastic/metal components, and key assets like the Singapore Smart Factory (advanced tooling, 3D metal printing, 100K cleanroom) (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3).
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:** Manufacturing segment showed "sharp improvement" in FY2024, first in over a decade (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4). FYSCS revenue declined in FY2024 and faced "significant weaknesses" in risk management, leading to an ongoing internal investigation (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5; Fu Yu FS Q424, p. 15). This move addresses underperforming non-core assets and inherent operational risks.

2.  **Leverage Geographically Diversified Manufacturing Footprint to Mitigate Geopolitical Risk**
    *   **Strategy:** Actively utilizing manufacturing presence in Singapore, Malaysia, and China to offer "geographical flexibility" to customers, responding to the trend of diversifying production away from China amid geopolitical uncertainties (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Operational manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China with over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3). Established supply chain resilience across these regions (Risk Management Report, FY2024, p. 100).
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:** Geopolitical tensions are noted as a driver for customers to "source production away from China" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). Singapore and Malaysia revenue contributions significantly increased (gained 20.9 ppt and 24.9 ppt respectively) in FY2024, while China's contribution decreased by 7.1 ppt, validating this strategy (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4; Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8).

3.  **Deepen Customer Relationships through Enhanced Value-Added Services**
    *   **Strategy:** Offers a "one-stop solution" for manufacturing needs, encompassing product design, tooling, production, assembly, and testing (Company Profile, FY2024, p. 3). The New Product Introduction (NPI) team provides value in early business cycles, building customer confidence in scalability and quality (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Expertise in product/tooling design, plastic/metal injection moulding, comprehensive secondary processes for "box build assembly" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 18). A skilled engineering workforce is fundamental (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 18).
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context:** This strategy has secured "new projects across a broad spectrum of industries" and refreshed the customer base to include "global leaders" (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 5), demonstrating tangible success in deepening partnerships and expanding market reach.

### C. Disconnects Between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While Fu Yu's objectives and strategies show alignment, certain areas present potential disconnects that warrant a critical assessment of management's reporting:

1.  **Human Capital Development for High-Precision Focus (Strategic Shift Verification):**
    *   **Disconnect:** The objective to move towards "even higher levels of precision" demands advanced skills (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 6). However, average training hours *decreased* from 16 to 13.2 hours per employee in FY2024 due to "training budget control and shift in company priorities" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 56).
    *   **Implication:** This underinvestment, despite increased CAPEX on machinery, suggests resource misalignment hindering high-precision objectives, as advanced machinery still requires highly skilled operators and technical staff.

2.  **Achieving Zero Workplace Incidents (Challenging Optimistic Claims):**
    *   **Disconnect:** The Group is "committed to achieving a zero-workplace incident rate" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 60). Yet, the "Recordable work-related injuries rate saw an increase from 3.5 in FY2023 to 4.6 in FY2024" (Sustainability Report, FY2024, p. 60).
    *   **Implication:** An increasing incident *rate*, despite potentially managed lost days, indicates current safety practices are not effectively mitigating all risks. This creates a gap between the ambitious "zero-incident" objective and actual operational outcomes, requiring re-evaluation of safety protocols.

3.  **Profitability and Strategic Refocus (Critical Stance):**
    *   **Disconnect:** The strategic shift to core manufacturing and divestment of the problematic supply chain segment is highlighted as successful, leading to "sharp improvement" in the core segment (Chairman's Message, FY2024, p. 4). However, the Group still recorded a net loss of S\$3.9 million in FY2024 (narrowed from S\$10.1 million in FY2023) (Financial Highlights, FY2024, p. 8).
    *   **Implication:** While the trajectory is positive, management's optimistic "early successes" and "growth trajectory" claims must be viewed critically against the continued overall net loss. Confidence in "long-term sustainable revenue" remains an aspiration, as strategic execution, while improving, has not yet achieved sustained group profitability.
