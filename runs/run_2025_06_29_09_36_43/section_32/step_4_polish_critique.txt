This appendix provides a large volume of data, extracted and presented cleanly in markdown tables. The introductory statement clearly defines its purpose as a "clean data reference tool" by excluding narrative and analytical insights, which is well-aligned with appendix best practices.

However, there are significant opportunities to improve its **CLARITY** and **ORGANIZATION**, making it a more effective reference tool.

Here's a detailed critique:

### Overall Strengths:

*   **Pure Data Focus:** Successfully adheres to the stated objective of presenting raw data without narrative or analysis.
*   **Data Integrity:** All numerical data, figures, and original formatting appear to be retained, which is crucial for an appendix.
*   **Source Citation:** Each table correctly cites its source document and page number, facilitating verification.
*   **Footnotes:** Necessary footnotes (e.g., for restated units, specific definitions) are included and well-placed.
*   **Table Formatting:** Markdown tables are generally well-formed and readable, with appropriate column alignment for numerical data.

### Areas for Improvement (Clarity & Organization):

1.  **Overly Broad Sections and Lack of Hierarchy:**
    *   **"3. Supporting Financials"** is excessively broad. It currently serves as a catch-all for various financial notes including detailed breakdowns of PPE, investment property, subsidiaries, goodwill, receivables, inventories, loans, cash, capital structure, payables, contract balances, income statement components, *discontinued operations*, *financial risk management*, and *leases*. This makes it very difficult for a user to quickly locate specific information.
    *   **"5. Shareholder & Governance Data"** suffers from the same problem. It lumps together board composition, anti-corruption, director attendance, director personal information, remuneration, share-based payments, and general shareholder information. Each of these sub-topics contains multiple tables.
    *   **"6. All Other Miscellaneous Data Tables"** indicates a failure in categorization. Ideally, an appendix should be logically structured enough that a "miscellaneous" section is minimal or non-existent.

2.  **Misplaced Data Blocks:**
    *   **Financial Risk Management (from original Section 3):** This is a critical and substantial block of data. It should have its own top-level section (e.g., "Financial Risk Management").
    *   **Lease Information (from original Section 3):** Similarly, the detailed lease tables (as lessee and lessor) are comprehensive enough to warrant their own top-level section (e.g., "Lease Information").
    *   **Financial Summaries (from original Section 2):** Tables like "Earnings per Ordinary Share (Basic and Diluted)," "Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share," "Operating (Loss)/Profit and Net (Loss)/Profit (Summary)," and "Financial Position Summary (1H2024 Snapshot)" are *summaries* or *derived metrics*. While valuable, they disrupt the flow of the core financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, Changes in Equity). A dedicated sub-section or even a new top-level section for "Financial Summaries and Key Ratios" could improve clarity. The "1H2024 Snapshot" is particularly distinct as it's from an interim report and summarises a different period than the annual statements, making its current placement slightly confusing.
    *   **"Corporate Information - Board of Directors & Committees" and "Our Business Memberships" (from original Section 6):** These are general corporate directory/information rather than performance or governance data. They would be better placed in a "Corporate and General Information" section.

3.  **Lack of Granular Sub-headings:**
    Even if the top-level sections are re-organized, the sheer number of tables within them necessitates more granular sub-headings (e.g., using `###` or `####` in Markdown) to group highly related tables. For example, all tables related to "Property, Plant and Equipment" should be under their own specific sub-heading within a broader financial notes section.

4.  **Ambiguous Symbols:**
    *   In the "Corporate ISO and QS Certification" table, the `^` symbol is used repeatedly without any explanation. This significantly impacts clarity as the reader cannot immediately understand what it signifies (e.g., "certified," "applicable," "in progress"). A simple footnote or legend is needed.

### Specific Recommendations for Improvement:
