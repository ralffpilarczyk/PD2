## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") is an established manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components. Its operating footprint reflects a strategic distribution of physical and human resources across Asia, designed to support its vertically-integrated business model and cater to an international customer base.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions

The Group's total workforce has seen a decline over the last three years, reducing from 1,535 employees in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024. This trend is accompanied by a shift in employee distribution across regions and functions, notably reflecting the Group's strategic adjustments and the cessation of its supply chain management services segment.

**Employee Headcount Trends**

| New Hire Rate        | 26.7%  | 60.7%  | 57.4%  | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49-50, "Employment"] |
| Turnover Rate        | 24.9%  | 63.8%  | 59.7%  | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 51, "Employment"]  |

*Note: FY2024 employee numbers exclude outsourced workers, unlike prior years, impacting direct comparability of total headcount figures. New hire and turnover rates for FY2022 & FY2023 were restated for GRI alignment.*

**Employee Distribution by Region (Headcount)**

| Region    | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Source                               |
| :-------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----------------------------------- |
| Singapore | 484    | 429    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"] |
| Malaysia  | 358    | 365    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"] |
| China     | 530    | 694    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"] |

The increase in Singapore's workforce (484 in FY2024 vs. 429 in FY2023) and a slight decrease in Malaysia, while China saw a substantial reduction (from 694 to 530), directly aligns with the Group's stated strategy to pivot manufacturing away from China. The significant new hire rate in Singapore (44.4%) compared to China (9.1%) in FY2024 further underscores this shift, supporting the growth of its Smart Factory and biomedical segment in Singapore.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance, and Ownership

Fu Yu operates a total production floor capacity exceeding 1.5 million square feet across its manufacturing sites. A cornerstone of its asset strategy is the Singapore Smart Factory, designed to support high-precision, high-value manufacturing.

**Key Operating Assets and Capacity**

*   **Total Production Floor Capacity**: >1.5 million sqft [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, "COMPANY PROFILE"]
*   **Singapore Smart Factory**:
    *   **Usable Space**: 9,348 sqm (approx. 100,621 sqft) [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"]
    *   **Capabilities**: Complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, 3D metal printing, 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, "COMPANY PROFILE"; Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"]
    *   **Technology**: Industry 4.0 machinery, optimized workflow, integrated cloud-based IT platform for paperless mould-making. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5-6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
    *   **Precision Level**: Stabilizing at 5-micron precision. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"]
*   **Renewable Energy Generation**: Up to 3,233 MWh (total across Singapore, Johor, and Penang facilities). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"]
*   **Ownership**: The Group's Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) are a mix of owned and leased assets. Additions to PPE included Right-of-Use assets (leased) of S$2,449,000 in FY2024 (S$1,150,000 in FY2023). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 113, "Note 3"; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 12, "Note 3"]

The strategic importance of the Singapore Smart Factory is paramount. It enables the Group to pursue higher-margin product categories (medical devices, drone technology, smart appliances) and move up the value chain by offering advanced tooling, 3D printing, and cleanroom manufacturing for biomedical products. This focus is directly linked to the "strategic transformation" mentioned by the Chairman.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

The Group operates 6 manufacturing sites across Singapore (2), Malaysia (2), and China (3), in addition to its Singapore headquarters.

**Geographic Footprint**

*   **Singapore**: Fu Yu Corporation Ltd. (Headquarters), Fu Yu Biomedical Pte Ltd (same address), Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 14, "OUR NETWORK"]
*   **Malaysia**: Fu Hao Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd (Penang), Classic Advantage Sdn Bhd (Johor). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 14, "OUR NETWORK"]
*   **China**: Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Dongguan), Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Suzhou), Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Zhuhai). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 14, "OUR NETWORK"]

The geographic footprint is well-aligned with the strategy to offer "geographical flexibility" in response to "geopolitical uncertainty" and "customers seeking to source production away from China." The increased revenue contribution from Singapore and Malaysia (40.2% and 31.9% of manufacturing revenue, respectively, in FY2024) and the decline from China (27.9%) directly support this narrative. The focus on "China-for-China and China-for-Asia" strategies for their Chinese facilities demonstrates adaptation to market realities.

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

The most significant change is the cessation of the Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) segment in Q4 FY2024. This move is presented as a reallocation of resources to the core manufacturing business, however, it is critical to note that an ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs (including significant weaknesses in risk management and potential misuse of resources) and an arbitral ruling against FYSCS raise red flags.

**Key Changes and Trends**

*   **Cessation of FYSCS**: All business activities ceased in Q4 FY2024. This segment contributed S$76.4 million in revenue in FY2024 (39.9% of total Group revenue). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 8, "FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS"; Page 15, "DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS"]
*   **Strategic Shift to High-Precision Manufacturing**: Continued investment in the Singapore Smart Factory, moving up the value chain to produce higher precision products (5-micron level). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"]
*   **Renewable Energy Integration**: Installation of solar panels completed in Singapore facilities in FY2024, with Malaysia (Fu Hao and Classic Advantage) installations operational in Q4 FY2024 and Q2 FY2025, respectively. Total renewable energy generation capacity of up to 3,233 MWh. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
*   **Automation Drive**: Increase automation levels in toolroom (aiming to reduce downtime by 40%), transition from hydraulic to electric machinery, integration of 3D printing. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
*   **Digital Transformation**: Implementation of a paperless mould-making process via an integrated cloud-based IT platform. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
*   **Workforce Optimization**: Decrease in overall headcount, with a regional shift of employees towards Singapore and away from China.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The operating structure directly supports Fu Yu's competitive positioning as a "one-stop solution" provider and a trusted manufacturing partner for innovative, high-performance products.

*   **Advanced Capabilities**: The Singapore Smart Factory, with its high-precision tooling, 3D printing, and cleanroom, positions Fu Yu to capture higher-value contracts in demanding sectors like medical devices and consumer electronics. This directly supports the strategy of "advanced tooling with high precision."
*   **Geographic Diversification**: A multi-country operating footprint (Singapore, Malaysia, China) provides "geographical flexibility" that caters to customers seeking to de-risk their supply chains from geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning China. This allows them to "offer geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty."
*   **Value-Added Services**: Providing services from product design to assembly and testing, along with the New Product Introduction (NPI) team, enhances customer stickiness and allows them to participate in the early stages of the business cycle.
*   **Sustainability Integration**: Investments in solar power and efforts in waste reduction (e.g., reusable containers, resin recycling) and eco-friendly materials enhance brand reputation and align with growing customer preferences for sustainable practices. The claim of "greener, more responsible footprint" is supported by tangible actions like solar panel installations.
*   **Operational Efficiency**: Automation efforts, MES implementation in Malaysia, and digitalization for paperless processes aim to improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance quality, supporting the pursuit of "operational excellence."

The significant impairment loss on property, plant and equipment in a China subsidiary (S$579,000 in FY2024) indicates underutilization or underperformance of assets in that region, a potential disconnect with the overall optimistic outlook on the Smart Factory and new project wins. The total value of significant customer revenue shifting from 1 customer in FY2023 to 3 in FY2024, all from the now-discontinued FYSCS segment, highlights a reliance on a segment that was deemed unsustainable and plagued with "significant weaknesses" and an ongoing investigation. This casts a shadow on the stability of past revenue contributions and questions the underlying health of that specific operational aspect, despite overall Group revenue growth.
