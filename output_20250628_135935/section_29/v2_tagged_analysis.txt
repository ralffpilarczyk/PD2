Analysis of Fu Yu Corporation's Operating Performance:  The provided document does not contain the necessary structured data to perform a comprehensive analysis of Fu Yu Corporation's operating performance over the last 24 months as requested.  Specifically, the lack of organized data under a "Section 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance" prevents the extraction of the required metrics, their trends, competitor benchmarks, and financial impacts.  Without this structured data, a detailed analysis with precise quantitative assessments, as requested, is impossible.  The following is a framework outlining how such an analysis *would* be conducted if the appropriate data were available.


**Framework for Analyzing Fu Yu Corporation's Operating Performance (Illustrative):**

To adequately describe the 3 most important operating metrics materially impacting Fu Yu Corporation's economic performance over the last 24 months, we would need detailed quarterly data on the following key operating metrics:  market share, unit pricing, and customer churn/retention.  These are prioritized based on their typical high impact on a company's overall economic performance.  The analysis would follow this structure for each metric:


**1. Market Share:**

* **Definition and Relevance:** Market share represents the percentage of the total market controlled by Fu Yu Corporation. It is crucial for understanding the Company's competitive position and growth potential.  Higher market share generally translates to greater revenue and profitability.
* **Historical Data (Illustrative):**  [INSERT Quarterly data for market share over 24 months.  Example: Q1 2023: 15%; Q2 2023: 16%; etc.] | [SOURCE:  (This would be filled with actual source)]

In conclusion,  a robust analysis of Fu Yu Corporation's operating performance requires access to detailed quarterly data on key operating metrics.
