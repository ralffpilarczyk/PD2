ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
-   **Prioritize Driver-Based Analysis:** Focus on identifying the underlying operational, strategic, or market drivers of financial outcomes, rather than merely reporting the numbers. This means explaining *why* a particular financial result occurred (e.g., "Revenue increased due to a 15% rise in average transaction value driven by premium product adoption," instead of just "Revenue increased by 15%").
-   **Leverage Comparative and Trend Analysis Systematically:** Always benchmark current financial performance against historical trends (multi-period), industry peers, and internal targets or budgets. This provides essential context for evaluating performance and highlights significant deviations or areas of strength.
-   **Connect Financials to Operational Reality:** Establish explicit and quantified links between financial line items and the specific operational activities, strategic initiatives, or market conditions that directly influence them. This ensures the analysis explains the 'why' behind the 'what' and provides actionable insights.
-   **Utilize Ratio Analysis for Deeper Understanding:** Systematically apply relevant financial ratios (e.g., profitability, liquidity, efficiency, solvency) to uncover relationships and diagnose financial health, operational efficiency, and risk levels beyond absolute figures.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
-   **Begin with the "So What?" and Audience Needs:** Before drafting any analysis, clearly define the primary questions the analysis must answer for its specific audience (e.g., investors, management, lenders). This ensures the output provides actionable insights and implications from the outset, rather than just descriptive data.
-   **Mandate Contextual Data Inclusion from the Start:** Incorporate external market conditions, industry benchmarks, competitive landscape, and internal strategic context into the initial data gathering and analysis framework. This prevents the initial draft from being a purely descriptive report lacking vital context.
-   **Pre-emptively Map Interdependencies:** Plan to analyze the interrelationships between different financial statements (e.g., Income Statement's impact on Balance Sheet and Cash Flow) and key metrics from the project's inception. This avoids presenting isolated observations and fosters a holistic understanding.
-   **Design for Root Cause Exploration, Not Just Identification:** Structure the initial analytical approach to systematically investigate the 'why' behind significant variances or trends, rather than simply identifying them. This means setting up a process for drill-down analysis from the very first attempt.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
-   **Emphasize Cash Flow Dynamics Equally with Profitability:** Go beyond just the Income Statement to thoroughly analyze cash flow generation, utilization, and working capital movements. Cash flow is a critical, often overlooked, indicator of true financial health and operational efficiency, especially for liquidity and solvency.
-   **Structure for Narrative and Actionability:** Present financial analysis as a coherent story, starting with an executive summary of key insights and their implications. Follow this with detailed supporting evidence and conclude with clear, actionable recommendations that directly address the findings.
-   **Highlight Material Changes and Their Quantified Impact:** Focus analytical depth on identifying and explaining only the *material* changes in financial performance and their quantified impact on key metrics. Avoid exhaustive recitation of every number; instead, prioritize insights that drive decision-making.
-   **Integrate Forward-Looking Implications:** Conclude financial analysis by discussing the future implications of current trends, potential risks, opportunities, and the sensitivity of key assumptions. This elevates the analysis from historical reporting to strategic foresight.
