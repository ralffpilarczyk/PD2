## SECTION 8: Summary Financials (Segment) - Expert Business Analyst Analysis

This section analyzes Maxis' financial performance by business segment, drawing insights from the Integrated Annual Report 2024 (AR 2024), Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Statements (24Q4 FS), First Quarter 2025 Financial Statements (25Q1 FS), and First Quarter 2025 Presentation (25Q1 Pres).

### a. Segment Data and Definitions

Maxis operates primarily across three core business segments:
*   **Mobile:** Encompasses Postpaid and Prepaid plans, offering voice, data, and digital services. This segment targets both premium and value-driven consumers.
*   **Home:** Provides high-speed fibre and wireless broadband (WBB) solutions, transforming homes into digital living spaces. This segment focuses on expanding fibre footprint and enhancing in-home connectivity.
*   **Enterprise:** Offers a comprehensive portfolio of enterprise products and ICT solutions, including connectivity, IoT, cloud, AI, and cybersecurity, tailored for corporates, mid-market, SMEs, wholesale, and the public sector.

It is important to note that Maxis' internal reporting and public disclosures do not provide a full breakdown of operating income (EBITDA/EBIT) or assets by individual business segment. The company states that "Segment reporting is not presented as the Group is primarily engaged in providing converged telecommunications services and solutions in Malaysia, whereby the measurement of profit or loss including EBIT... is on a Group basis." Furthermore, while Maxis defines "Mobile" and "Home" as distinct segments, their public financial reporting aggregates these into "Consumer Business Revenue." This limitation restricts a granular segment-level profitability and asset efficiency analysis for Mobile and Home individually.

### b. Time Periods and Segment-Specific Forecasts

The analysis covers:
*   **Last 3 Financial Years:** FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024.
*   **5 Most Recent Quarters:** 1Q24, 2Q24, 3Q24, 4Q24, and 1Q25.
*   **Segment-Specific Forecasts/Guidance:** Maxis provides overall group-level guidance for FY2025, which implicitly covers all segments. For FY2025, Maxis projects a low single-digit growth in service revenue, flat to low single-digit growth in EBITDA, and CAPEX spending to remain less than RM1 billion [4, p.20].

### c. Additional Data

*   **One-time items by segment:** Specific one-time items are not broken down by segment. The increase in FY2024 Profit After Tax (PAT) was partly due to "one-off adjustments incurred in the prior financial year of FY2023" [1, p.9]. An additional one-time dividend for Q4 2024 was also declared [1, p.5].
*   **Segment-specific metrics:** Key metrics like Revenue Generating Subscribers (RGS), Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for Postpaid, Prepaid, and Home Connectivity, Home Connections, and 5G device subscriptions/penetration are provided.
*   **Inter-segment transactions:** Inter-company transactions are eliminated in consolidation and are not detailed by segment [1, p.106].

#### Segment Analysis

*   **Growth Trends by Segment:**
    *   **Consumer Business:** This segment is the largest revenue contributor. Annually, Consumer revenue grew by 2.7% in FY2024 to RM7.26 billion [1, p.8]. Quarterly trends show slight fluctuations, with a recent dip in 1Q25 to RM1,773 million (down 2.7% QoQ and 1.7% YoY) [5, p.17]. This decline is attributed to changes in the Maxis Device Care offering and reduced interconnect rates [5, p.17]. Within Consumer, Postpaid subscriptions show consistent growth (up 9.1% YoY in 1Q25 to 3.98 million subscribers) [4, p.20], while Prepaid subscriptions remained relatively stable but with declining ARPU, indicating potential cannibalization or increased value-seeking behavior. Home Connections show steady growth, increasing 4.5% YoY in FY2024 to 784,000 [1, p.8] and further to 787,000 in 1Q25 [4, p.20].
    *   **Enterprise Business:** This segment demonstrates robust growth, increasing by 6.8% in FY2024 to RM1.61 billion [1, p.8]. Quarterly, Enterprise revenue in 1Q25 was RM398 million, up 2.8% YoY, but down 6.6% QoQ [5, p.17]. The QoQ decline is attributed to higher non-recurring revenue in the previous quarter from project completions [5, p.17]. Management emphasizes diversification of service offerings to cater to specific enterprise needs [1, p.8].
    *   **5G Adoption:** Maxis has shown strong progress in 5G adoption, with subscriptions growing 50% to 3.7 million users and penetration increasing from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024 [1, p.27]. This indicates successful inclusive 5G propositions.

*   **Margin Evolution by Segment:**
    *   As segment-level operating income is not disclosed, a direct margin analysis by segment is not possible. However, overall **Group EBITDA margin on service revenue** improved from 46.2% in FY2023 to 46.5% in FY2024 [1, p.10], indicating effective cost management despite revenue growth. In 1Q25, this margin further improved to 48.6% from 43.8% in 4Q24, driven by "lower device costs" and "effective cost management" [5, p.17]. This suggests that while device sales contribute to total revenue, their associated costs can impact overall profitability. Maxis' EBITDA margin on service revenue of 46.5% in FY2024 is competitive and generally in line with established regional telecommunications operators, reflecting effective cost management in a mature market.

*   **Asset Efficiency by Segment:**
    *   Due to the absence of segment-specific asset data, a detailed analysis of asset efficiency by segment cannot be performed. Group-level total assets slightly decreased from RM22,781 million in FY2023 to RM22,323 million in FY2024 [3, p.3], while revenue increased, suggesting an improvement in overall asset utilization.

#### Contribution Analysis

*   **Segment Performance Comparison:**
    *   The **Consumer segment** remains the dominant revenue driver, contributing approximately 82% of service revenue in FY2024 (RM7.26B Consumer / RM8.87B Service Revenue) [1, p.8]. Its growth is primarily volume-driven (Postpaid subscriptions, Home connections) though ARPU trends need careful monitoring.
    *   The **Enterprise segment**, while smaller, is growing at a faster rate (6.8% in FY2024 vs. 2.7% for Consumer) [1, p.8], highlighting its increasing importance as a growth engine and a diversification strategy beyond traditional consumer mobile services.
*   **Segment Contribution to Overall Results:**
    *   The Consumer segment's sheer volume dictates overall revenue trends. However, the Enterprise segment's higher growth rate provides a crucial boost to overall service revenue growth, which was 3.5% in FY2024 [1, p.8]. The overall EBITDA and PAT improvements are a result of combined segment performance and disciplined cost management across the entire organization.
*   **Strategic Importance by Segment:**
    *   **Consumer:** Remains the bedrock, providing stable, recurring revenue and a large subscriber base. Strategic focus on "bundling and cross-selling to construct consumer fortress" [4, p.3] aims to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn in a competitive market. The continued growth in postpaid and home connections is vital.
    *   **Enterprise:** Increasingly strategic for future growth and diversification. Maxis' focus on "telco adjacent services" (managed services, cloud, IoT, cybersecurity) [4, p.3] aligns with broader digital transformation trends in Malaysia, positioning Maxis as a key enabler for businesses. This segment offers higher growth potential and potentially higher-value services.
    *   **5G:** Critical for both segments, enabling next-generation services, enhancing customer experience, and unlocking new enterprise solutions. Maxis' leadership in 5G adoption is a competitive advantage [1, p.27].

#### Cash Flow Assessment by Segment (Group-level only)

Segment-specific cash flow is not disclosed. At the group level, Operating Free Cash Flow (OFCF) improved by 8.6% year-on-year to RM3,057 million in FY2024 [1, p.9], driven by improved working capital management and operational efficiencies. The QoQ dip in 4Q24 OFCF (RM431 million) was attributed to "higher regulatory related payments" [3, p.17], but rebounded strongly in 1Q25 to RM883 million [5, p.17]. CAPEX saw a significant reduction in FY2024 (down 17.0% to RM674 million) [1, p.9], reflecting a "prudent approach" and "strategic focus on essential investments" [1, p.9]. This disciplined CAPEX management contributes positively to OFCF. Maxis' CAPEX-to-service revenue ratio of 7.6% in FY2024 is notably lower than typical investment cycles for telcos in growth phases (often 15-20%), reflecting its "prudent approach" and focus on optimizing existing infrastructure rather than aggressive greenfield expansion, which could be a strategic choice in a mature market or a response to regulatory changes.

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends by Segment

#### Maxis' overall strategic pillars for 2025:
1.  Bundle and Cross-Sell to Construct Consumer Fortress
2.  Grow Enterprise Business, Without Straying Far from Core
3.  Building Infrastructure and Wholesale
4.  Digitalise and Adopt AI
5.  Operating with Excellence [4, p.3]

#### Mobile Segment
*   **Key Achievements:**
    1.  **Strong 5G Adoption & Network Performance:** Maxis achieved 3.7 million 5G device subscriptions in 2024, a 50% YoY increase, with 5G penetration reaching 38% [1, p.27]. This reflects successful "inclusive and accessible 5G propositions" and effective traffic offload from 4G to 5G [1, p.27]. The company also conducted Malaysia's first 5G-Advanced technology trial, demonstrating leadership in next-gen network capabilities [1, p.28].
    2.  **Postpaid Subscriber Growth & Digital Self-Service:** The postpaid segment saw a 5.1% revenue increase in FY2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and pre-to-postpaid migrations [1, p.27]. Digital transformation efforts are significant, with one in four postpaid customers completing contracting/upgrading digitally and over 80% of prepaid internet purchases via the self-serve app by end of 2024 [1, p.27]. Maxis also boasts an "all-time high" Net Promoter Score (TP-NPS) of +70 [1, p.28].
*   **Key Challenges:**
    1.  **Prepaid Revenue Decline & ARPU Pressure:** Prepaid revenue declined 2.1% in FY2024 [1, p.8], and Prepaid ARPU continued its downward trend, reaching RM34.3 in 1Q25 [4, p.20]. This indicates persistent competition and a shift towards more value-driven plans, potentially impacting profitability in this sub-segment. The declining ARPU trends in both Postpaid and Prepaid segments are consistent with broader industry pressures in Malaysia, driven by intense competition and consumers seeking more value-driven plans. Management acknowledges focusing on "encouraging prepaid customers to transition to postpaid plans" to counter this [1, p.8].
    2.  **Evolving 5G Landscape:** The "recent award of the second 5G network has presented new challenges" [1, p.7], introducing uncertainty and potential increased competition in the 5G wholesale market. Maxis' existing agreement with DNB ensures continued 5G services, but the long-term strategy in a dual network model remains in flux, requiring active engagement with stakeholders [1, p.7].
*   **Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
    1.  **"Resilient Service Revenue" vs. Q1 2025 Decline:** While management states "Resilient Service Revenue in 1Q25" [4, p.4], the reported service revenue actually decreased by 0.9% YoY and 3.4% QoQ [4, p.4]. The explanation points to "changes in Maxis Device Care offering" and "reduced interconnect rates" [5, p.17], which affected revenue recognition. This highlights that "resilience" may refer to underlying demand, but reported figures show a contraction.
    2.  **ARPU Stability Claims vs. Declining Trends:** The CEO's statement mentions "maintained a stable ARPU in the quarter" (referring to Q4 2024) [2, p.6]. However, the data shows a general downward trend in Consumer Postpaid ARPU (from RM75.1 in 1Q24 to RM71.8 in 1Q25) and Consumer Prepaid ARPU (from RM37.2 in 1Q24 to RM34.3 in 1Q25) [4, p.20]. While 4Q24 ARPU was stable QoQ, the overall trend over the past 5 quarters suggests ongoing ARPU pressure, which management downplays.

#### Home Segment
*   **Key Achievements:**
    1.  **Consistent Revenue Growth & Expanding Fibre Footprint:** Home connectivity revenue grew by 7.4% in FY2024 to RM993 million [1, p.8] and further by 4.1% YoY in 1Q25 to RM254 million [5, p.17]. Maxis expanded its fibre network, providing access to over 7.8 million premises and connecting ~784,000 homes by end of FY2024 [1, p.3, 8].
    2.  **Enhanced Service Reliability & Customer Experience:** Maxis improved service reliability, evidenced by reduced network complaints per 1,000 subscribers and widespread adoption of WiFi 6 routers leading to fewer WiFi-related issues [1, p.31]. Same-day installation services were introduced in key urban centers, improving customer satisfaction [1, p.31].
*   **Key Challenges:**
    1.  **Highly Competitive Broadband Market:** Management acknowledges the "extremely competitive" broadband market [2, p.7]. While Maxis maintains strong ARPU, aggressive pricing from competitors could pressure future growth and margins.
    2.  **Infrastructure Expansion Costs:** Expanding fibre footprint requires significant investment. While CAPEX was managed lower overall, sustained infrastructure build-out is a mid-term priority [1, p.31], which could impact future free cash flow.
*   **Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
    1.  **"Strong ARPU" vs. Slight Fluctuations:** Management states "maintained strong ARPU" [2, p.7] for Home. While Home Connectivity ARPU has generally remained high (around RM109-110), it has seen slight fluctuations, including a dip from RM110.4 in 1Q24 to RM109.0 in 3Q24 before recovering slightly to RM110.1 in 1Q25 [4, p.20]. This suggests that "strong" is relative to other segments, but not entirely stable.
    2.  **Emphasis on "Access to Premises" vs. Actual Penetration Rate:** Management highlights expanding fibre "access to over 7.8 million premises" [1, p.3], implying broad reach. However, the actual number of "Home Connections" (787,000 in 1Q25) represents a relatively low penetration rate of approximately 10% of premises passed. This suggests that converting broad network reach into a higher customer penetration rate remains a significant challenge in the "extremely competitive broadband market" [2, p.7], a nuance that the emphasis on "access" might implicitly downplay.

#### Enterprise Segment
*   **Key Achievements:**
    1.  **Robust Revenue Growth & Diversified Offerings:** Enterprise revenue grew by 6.8% in FY2024 to RM1.61 billion [1, p.8], driven by increased mobile subscriptions and a significant 11.5% increase in Fixed & Solutions revenue [1, p.8]. This highlights successful diversification beyond traditional mobile into ICT solutions.
    2.  **Leadership in Digital Transformation & AI Adoption:** Maxis became Malaysia's first telco to launch GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) in September 2024, enabling AI training for enterprises [1, p.33]. They are also a key partner for global cloud providers (e.g., AWS) and are actively migrating legacy networks to SD-WAN [1, p.33].
*   **Key Challenges:**
    1.  **Reliance on Non-Recurring Revenue:** The higher fixed & solutions revenue in 4Q24 was "driven by non-recurring charges from various project completions" [2, p.8], leading to a QoQ decline in 1Q25 [5, p.17]. This suggests potential volatility in revenue if recurring service contracts are not consistently secured.
    2.  **Intensified Competition in New Growth Areas:** While Maxis is expanding into new areas like IoT, cloud, and AI, these markets are also highly competitive with specialized players. The "new business risk" and "competition risk" are acknowledged in the AR [1, p.22-23].
*   **Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
    1.  **"Strong Demand" vs. QoQ Dip:** Management indicated "strong demand for our digital solutions" [2, p.8] in 1Q25, but Enterprise revenue saw a 6.6% QoQ decrease from 4Q24 [5, p.17]. While explained by "higher non-recurring revenue" in the prior quarter, the statement could create an impression of continuous sequential growth that the numbers don't fully support.
    2.  **"Leadership" in New Areas vs. Acknowledged "New Business Risk" and "Competition Risk":** Management strongly positions Maxis as a "leader" in new, high-growth areas like AI adoption and digital transformation [1, p.33]. However, the company's own risk disclosures explicitly highlight "new business risk" and "competition risk" when venturing into these very areas [1, p.22-23]. This creates a disconnect between the narrative of established leadership and the inherent challenges and uncertainties of operating in nascent, highly competitive markets with specialized players.
