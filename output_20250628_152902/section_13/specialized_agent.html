### **2. Top 3 Corporate Strategies (Current Methods with Capabilities)**

1.  **Refocus on Core High-Precision Manufacturing and Strategic Customer/Market Diversification**
    *   **Method**: The Group ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") in Q4 FY2024, reallocating resources to its core manufacturing business. It is leveraging its advanced tooling capabilities and New Product Introduction ("NPI") team to secure new projects, particularly in higher-margin product categories. The strategy also includes offering geographical flexibility to customers seeking to diversify production away from China.
    *   **Capabilities**:
        *   **High-precision Manufacturing Expertise**: Over 45 years of operating knowledge in high-end precision plastic and metal components, including complex mould inserts, high-precision tooling, and 3D metal printing. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, Company Profile; Page 5, Chairman's Message)
        *   **Vertically-Integrated Services**: Capabilities cover product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly, and testing, providing a one-stop solution. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, Company Profile)
        *   **Advanced Facilities**: Flagship Smart Factory in Singapore with Industry 4.0 machinery and a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 3, Company Profile; Page 5, Chairman's Message)
        *   **Global Network**: Operates 6 strategic manufacturing sites across Singapore, Malaysia, and China, with over 1.5 million square feet of production floor capacity, enabling geographical flexibility for customers. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 2, Company Profile; Page 6, Chairman's Message)
        *   **New Product Introduction (NPI) Team**: Proved ability to add value in early stages of the business cycle for new customers. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, Chairman's Message)
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context**: This strategy builds on the "early successes" in FY2024 of focusing on high-precision manufacturing, which led to a sharp improvement in the core manufacturing segment. New projects have been secured across medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances, expanding the customer base to global leaders. The geopolitical landscape is driving customers to diversify supply chains away from China. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5-6, Chairman's Message)

2.  **Drive Operational Efficiency and Advanced Technology Integration**
    *   **Method**: Investing in Industry 4.0 machinery and optimizing shopfloor layouts. Implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform. Progressively replacing older hydraulic machinery with energy-efficient electric alternatives. Incorporating 3D printing and additive manufacturing for precise material usage. Implementing cost-containment measures.
    *   **Capabilities**:
        *   **Smart Factory Infrastructure**: The Singapore Smart Factory is optimized with Industry 4.0 machinery and shopfloor layouts. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, Chairman's Message)
        *   **IT Platform**: ERP integrated cloud-based IT platform for streamlined processes and paperless mould-making. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, Chairman's Message; Page 47, Sustainability Report, Our Initiatives)

        *   **Cost Management**: Ability to implement cost-containment measures to maintain competitiveness. (Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 30, Review of performance of the Group)
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context**: This strategy aims to reduce downtime by 40% and move towards higher precision levels. It helps mitigate rising energy costs and contributes to a greener footprint. The transition to electric machinery and integration of 3D printing are ongoing efforts to enhance efficiency and reduce waste. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, Chairman's Message; Page 31, Sustainability Report, TCFD; Page 35, Sustainability Report, TCFD)

3.  **Integrate Sustainability Practices and Eco-Friendly Materials into Operations and Offerings**
    *   **Method**: Actively exploring and implementing cleaner energy solutions (e.g., solar panels). Engaging with suppliers and customers to transition to eco-friendly resins like biodegradable bio-resin. Implementing a comprehensive "3Rs" (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) waste management program. Ensuring supply chain compliance with environmental laws (RoHS, REACH agreements). Leveraging Smart Factory for environmental monitoring.
    *   **Capabilities**:
        *   **Renewable Energy Generation**: Installed solar panels on facilities in Singapore (completed FY2024), Johor (operational Q4 FY2024), and Penang (operational Q2 FY2025), generating up to 3,233 MWh of renewable energy. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, Chairman's Message; Page 36, Sustainability Report, TCFD; Page 47, Sustainability Report, Our Initiatives)
        *   **Sustainable Material Development**: Active discussions with suppliers and customers for biodegradable bio-resin (from sugar cane fibre) for disposables, consumables, and packaging caps. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 32, Sustainability Report, TCFD; Page 36, Sustainability Report, TCFD; Page 47, Sustainability Report, Our Initiatives)
        *   **Waste Management Infrastructure**: Comprehensive waste sorting and management program (paper, food, electronic waste); promotion of resin reuse and packaging return programs. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 43-46, Sustainability Report, Waste)
        *   **Environmental Compliance Systems**: Annual vendor evaluation, RoHS and REACH agreements with suppliers, ISO 14001 certification across all factories. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 46-47, Sustainability Report, Environmental-friendly Supply Chain)
        *   **Smart Monitoring**: Smart Factory aids in monitoring and optimizing electricity usage and customer carbon footprint. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 47, Sustainability Report, Our Initiatives)
    *   **Competitive and Historical Context**: This responds to the growing significance of climate change, increased regulatory oversight, rising energy costs, and shifting consumer preferences towards sustainable products. It also allows the company to explore government subsidies and green financing opportunities. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 17, Sustainability Report; Page 30-36, Sustainability Report, TCFD)

### **3. Disconnects**

1.  **Pace of Carbon Emission Reduction (Short-Term Target vs. Actual)**
    *   **Objective**: Reduce Scope 2 carbon emissions by 3.0% in FY2024, using FY2023 as the baseline. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 41, Sustainability Report, Energy Consumption)
    *   **Strategy/Result**: The company achieved an actual reduction of Scope 2 carbon emissions of 1.4% in FY2024. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 41, Sustainability Report, Energy Consumption)
    *   **Disconnect**: The actual reduction in Scope 2 carbon emissions for FY2024 was less than half of the stated short-term target, indicating that current strategies or their implementation speed were insufficient to meet the immediate environmental KPI.

2.  **Board Gender Diversity**
    *   **Objective/Policy**: The Nominating Committee aims to identify and recommend a suitable female director for appointment to the Board within "the next few years leading up to 2026" to diversify skill sets and gender. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 77, Corporate Governance Report, Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance)
    *   **Current State**: As of 31 December 2024, the Board does not comprise any female directors, with 100% male representation. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 54, Sustainability Report, Diversity and Equal Opportunity; Page 76, Corporate Governance Report, Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance)
    *   **Disconnect**: There is a clear gap between the stated objective of improving gender diversity on the Board by 2026 and the current 0% female representation. While a timeframe is set, the absence of a female director now highlights this immediate disconnect.

3.  **Realization of Automation Benefits (Toolroom Downtime Reduction)**
    *   **Objective**: From FY2025, seek to increase automation levels of the toolroom to enable continuous production and reduce downtime by 40% compared to a typical facility. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, Chairman's Message, Forward Strategies)
    *   **Strategy/Status**: Most of the testing for the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform has been completed. (Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, Chairman's Message, Forward Strategies)
    *   **Disconnect**: While the enabling technology (ERP platform) is largely tested, the significant operational benefit (40% downtime reduction in toolroom automation) is a future target "from this year" (FY2025) and not yet realized or reported as a current achievement. This indicates that a key strategic initiative is still in the transition phase, with the desired outcomes yet to fully manifest in operations.
