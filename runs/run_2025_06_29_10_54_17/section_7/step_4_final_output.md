## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

This analysis critically reviews Fu Yu Corporation Limited's consolidated financial performance for FY2024 and 2H2024, focusing on the continuing manufacturing segment. While management frames the discontinuation of its supply chain management services (FYSCS) as a "strategic transformation," this analysis reveals severe underlying governance issues that impact comparative financials and investor confidence. The reporting periods are the full financial year ended 31 December 2024 (FY2024) and the interim period of 2H2024.

### Key Financial Trends & Critical Concerns

**Revenue Growth:**
Revenue from continuing manufacturing operations grew 10.5% in FY2024 (17.2% in 2H2024), driven by increased sales in Singapore and Malaysia. However, persistent decline in China remains a drag on overall performance. [AR p.7, p.8, p.90, FS Q424 p.4]

**Margin Evolution & Profitability:**
Gross Profit Margin for continuing operations improved significantly to 13.5% (FY2024) from 11.7% (FY2023), reflecting higher-margin projects. EBITDA margin also turned positive, soaring from 0.6% in FY2023 to 7.4% in FY2024. Operating Income (EBIT) shifted to a profit. Despite these operational gains, the company *remained unprofitable at the net income level* in FY2024 (S$(1.2)M net loss), and critically, continued to incur net losses in both 1H2024 (S$(0.7)M) and 2H2024 (S$(0.5)M). This highlights that, after accounting for depreciation, finance costs, and taxes, the "core manufacturing business" is still not generating sustainable net profit, undermining the "sharp improvement" narrative for bottom-line investors. [AR p.7, p.8, FS Q424 p.4]

**Cash Flow Generation & Quality of Earnings:**
Operating cash flow saw a significant turnaround from a net outflow in FY2023 to a S$3.6M net inflow in FY2024. While management attributes this to "improved working capital management," the underlying cash conversion remains fragile and highly volatile. The cash conversion (OCF/EBITDA) for FY2024 stands at a low 42.4%, and notably, 2H2024 saw a *negative* OCF of S$(0.1)M despite a robust S$5.0M EBITDA. This fundamental disconnect between reported operational earnings and actual cash generation raises red flags about the quality of earnings and the sustainability of positive cash flow. Manufacturing Capex increased to 6.0% of revenue in FY2024 (from 3.6%), reflecting equipment investments. Given the volatile and often negative half-yearly operating cash flows, the funding source for this increased capex needs close monitoring to avoid liquidity strain. [AR p.7, p.8, FS Q424 p.24]

**Persistent China Weakness:**
China operations continued to be a significant drag, with an 11.8% revenue decline and a S$4.3M loss before tax in FY2024. Management's passive "slower-than-expected recovery" explanation lacks a clear, proactive strategy to mitigate or address this persistent loss-making segment. [AR p.8]

**FYSCS Discontinuation & The Qualified Audit Opinion (The Most Critical Red Flag):**
The cessation of the supply chain management services segment (FYSCS), initially framed by management as a strategic move to focus on manufacturing, was in fact necessitated by an internal audit uncovering 'significant weaknesses,' 'unverifiable arrangements,' and 'irregular' claims. This investigation culminated in a *qualified audit opinion* on the financial statements, explicitly citing an inability to determine the potential financial impact of these findings. This represents a severe breakdown of internal controls, indicating potential misstatements, lack of transparency, and hints at unquantified liabilities or even fraud. Such a situation profoundly erodes investor confidence, renders the entire financial statement unreliable, and poses an existential threat to the company's ability to raise capital and secure loans, potentially attracting regulatory scrutiny or delisting risk. The FYSCS segment also incurred S$3.3M goodwill impairment and S$2.7M net loss prior to cessation. Management's forward-looking optimism for FY2025, based on order book increases, dramatically downplays these significant, unresolved financial, legal, and reputational risks. [FS Q424 p.26; AR p.7, p.8, p.61, p.104, Note 32; FS Q424 p.29]

**Recommendations for Deeper Analysis:**
For comprehensive understanding, future analyses should incorporate key balance sheet metrics (Net Debt, Cash & Equivalents, working capital) to assess liquidity and cash flow sustainability. Crucially, diligent investors must demand full disclosure on the FYSCS investigation's scope, findings, and definitive financial impact to properly assess the unquantified systemic risks.
