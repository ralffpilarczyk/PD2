<p><strong>Benchmarking:</strong><br>
The provided documents do not include specific benchmarking data against key competitors or industry averages for manufacturing revenue growth. Further analysis would benefit from obtaining industry reports or competitor financial statements to provide a more comprehensive external benchmark. However, the Group's 10.5% year-on-year growth in manufacturing revenue in FY2024 contrasts with a challenging global economic environment, suggesting resilience and effective strategy implementation within its niche.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis of Drivers:</strong><br>
The growth in manufacturing revenue, particularly the strong performance in 1H 2024, was primarily driven by:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Higher Order Volumes and New Projects:</strong> The Group secured higher order volumes from existing customers and new projects, particularly in the biomedical and consumer segments. These wins were a direct result of the Group's strategic transformation, including investments in advanced tooling and the introduction of a New Product Introduction ("NPI") team<sup>1</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Transformation and High-Precision Focus:</strong> The Company's focus on high-precision manufacturing, evidenced by the capabilities of its Smart Factory in Singapore (e.g., manufacturing complex mould inserts, high-precision 3D metal printing, 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products), has allowed it to secure projects requiring advanced capabilities<sup>2</sup>. These include new projects in medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances, expanding its customer base to global leaders in wound care, personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines<sup>3</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Geographical Diversification:</strong> While China operations saw a revenue decline of 11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024 due to a slower-than-expected economic recovery, this was more than offset by strong growth in Singapore (20.9% to S$46.2 million) and Malaysia (24.9% to S$36.6 million), particularly from medical and consumer product demand<sup>4</sup>. This shift reduced China's contribution to total manufacturing revenue by 7.1 percentage points, while Singapore and Malaysia collectively gained 20.9 ppt and 24.9 ppt, respectively<sup>5</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Order Book Conversion:</strong> The Group’s order book at the end of FY2024 increased by 20% year-on-year, with several high-precision projects transitioning from gestation to mass production, indicating a pipeline for future revenue realization<sup>6</sup>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Sustainability of Performance Trend:</strong><br>
The positive manufacturing revenue trend appears sustainable in the near to medium term given the 20% year-on-year increase in the order book at FY2024 end and the commencement of mass production for high-precision projects<sup>7</sup>. The strategic focus on higher-margin sectors like biomedical and consumer, coupled with geographical diversification away from over-reliance on China, provides a more resilient revenue base<sup>8</sup>.<br>
However, external headwinds such as longer shipping lead times, higher raw material costs, and geopolitical tensions (including US-China trade tensions) could impact the pace of recovery<sup>9</sup>. The Company's China operations are mitigating this by focusing on "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" strategies<sup>10</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Quantify Financial Impact:</strong><br>
The S$11.0 million increase in manufacturing revenue (from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024) significantly contributed to the Group's improved financial performance. This growth directly supported the sharp narrowing of net loss from continuing operations to S$1.2 million in FY2024 from S$7.6 million in FY2023, representing a S$6.4 million improvement in profitability from the manufacturing segment before considering other factors<sup>11</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Given the significant geographical shift in manufacturing revenue, particularly the decline in China and robust growth in Singapore and Malaysia, what specific strategies and resource allocations are planned for each region to sustain growth and capitalize on geopolitical shifts, especially considering the stated focus on "China-for-China" and "China-for-Asia" for China operations?</li>
    <li>The order book increased 20% year-on-year by end of FY2024, with several high-precision projects moving to mass production. Can management provide a detailed breakdown of these new projects by industry segment (e.g., medical, consumer, automotive) and expected revenue contribution over the next 12-24 months, distinguishing between new customers and increased volumes from existing customers?</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin</h3>

<p><strong>Definition and Relevance:</strong><br>
Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM) is the ratio of gross profit (revenue minus cost of sales) from the manufacturing segment to its total manufacturing revenue, expressed as a percentage. This metric is crucial for assessing the Company's operational efficiency, pricing power, and ability to manage production costs. A higher GPM indicates greater profitability from each unit sold, directly impacting the Company's overall economic performance and its capacity for reinvestment and strategic initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Data (Last 24 Months - Bi-annual):</strong><br>
The manufacturing segment's gross profit margin has notably improved over the last 24 months, reflecting the Group’s strategic focus and efficiency gains.</p>

<p class="source"><em>Source: Calculated from Fu Yu Corporation Limited, Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements for the Six Months Period and Twelve Months Period Ended 31 December 2024 ("FS"), Section B(i) (Page 4) by dividing Gross Profit (Continuing Operations) by Revenue (Continuing Operations); Fu Yu Corporation Limited, Annual Report 2024 ("AR"), Financial Highlights (Page 8).</em></p>

<p><strong>Benchmarking:</strong><br>
The provided documents do not offer specific benchmarking data for manufacturing gross profit margin against competitors or industry averages. Further analysis would benefit from obtaining industry reports or competitor financial statements to provide a more comprehensive external benchmark. However, the reported improvement from 11.7% to 13.5% (1.8 percentage points) in FY2024 signifies enhanced internal operational performance.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis of Drivers:</strong><br>
The improvement in manufacturing GPM is largely attributable to:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Focus on High-Precision, Higher-Margin Products:</strong> The Group's strategic pivot towards high-precision manufacturing services and new product introduction (NPI) has enabled it to secure projects in sectors like biomedical and advanced consumer products, which typically command higher margins<sup>12</sup>. This shift in revenue mix contributes to overall margin expansion.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Efficiency and Automation:</strong> Investments in the flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, equipped with Industry 4.0 machinery, are enhancing workflow and efficiency<sup>13</sup>. The ongoing replacement of older hydraulic machines with energy-efficient electric alternatives aims to improve operational efficiency and reduce oil consumption, contributing to lower production costs<sup>14</sup>. The Group is also working to increase automation levels in its toolroom to reduce downtime by 40%<sup>15</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Management:</strong> A reduction in selling and administrative expenses (down 20.4% to S$17.0 million in FY2024 from S$21.6 million in FY2023 for continuing operations) contributed to overall profitability, although this is below the gross profit line<sup>16</sup>. The cessation of the supply chain management services segment also allows reallocation of resources to the core manufacturing business, potentially improving focus and efficiency<sup>17</sup>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Sustainability of Performance Trend:</strong><br>
The sustained improvement in manufacturing GPM, particularly in 1H 2024, is likely sustainable due to the Group’s ongoing strategic initiatives to move up the value chain towards higher-precision products and its continuous investment in advanced manufacturing technologies and automation<sup>18</sup>. The commitment to stabilizing high-precision products at the 5-micron level and moving to even higher levels of precision suggests continued focus on premium offerings<sup>19</sup>.<br>
However, potential challenges include increasing energy prices (influenced by carbon taxes and China's energy transition), and fluctuations in raw material costs, which could exert pressure on margins<sup>20</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Quantify Financial Impact:</strong><br>
The 1.8 percentage point expansion in the manufacturing gross profit margin (from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024) on the FY2024 manufacturing revenue of S$114.9 million translated to an additional S$2.06 million in gross profit for the year (calculated as (13.5% - 11.7%) * S$114.9 million)<sup>21</sup>. This direct increase in gross profit significantly contributed to the overall reduction in the Group's net loss from continuing operations.</p>

<p><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>The manufacturing gross profit margin significantly improved to 13.5% in FY2024. To what extent is this improvement attributable to (a) a shift in product mix towards higher-margin, high-precision components, (b) enhanced operational efficiencies from Smart Factory investments and automation, and (c) pricing adjustments? How sustainable are these drivers in the face of potential raw material cost inflation and energy price volatility?</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>3. Employee Turnover Rate</h3>

<p><strong>Definition and Relevance:</strong><br>
Employee Turnover Rate measures the percentage of employees who leave the Company over a specific period. While not a direct customer-related metric, it is a crucial operating metric, especially in precision manufacturing, as it directly impacts operational stability, productivity, product quality, and the retention of specialized knowledge and skills. High turnover can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, decreased morale, and potential disruptions in production, thus materially affecting the Company's economic performance.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Data (Last 24 Months - Annually):</strong><br>
The Group's employee turnover rate has seen a significant reported decrease in FY2024; however, a change in reporting methodology should be noted.</p>

<p class="source"><em>Source: Fu Yu Corporation Limited, Annual Report 2024 ("AR"), Developing Our Workforce (Page 51).</em></p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note on Comparability:</strong> It is important to note that the turnover rates for FY2022 and FY2023 have been restated to align with the GRI formula (Number of resignations/Total number of employees), and from FY2024 onwards, employment numbers only include Fu Yu's direct employees (permanent, temporary, full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours), excluding outsourced workers. Direct year-on-year comparison based on this new methodology will only be consistently available from FY2025 onwards. Despite this, the reported 24.9% in FY2024 indicates a significant improvement within the new definition<sup>22</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Benchmarking:</strong><br>
The provided documents do not include specific benchmarking data for employee turnover rate against industry averages or competitors. The Group's stated goal is to maintain a turnover rate (exclusive of temporary workers) below 30%<sup>23</sup>. The reported 24.9% in FY2024 (within the new methodology) suggests the Company is meeting this internal benchmark.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis of Drivers:</strong><br>
The reported decrease in employee turnover in FY2024, within the new reporting methodology, can be attributed to several internal initiatives and strategic focus on human capital:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Employee Well-being and Engagement:</strong> The Group has initiated various programs to enhance employee well-being and foster a positive work environment, including recreational and wellness activities (e.g., hiking, team bonding, company outings), festive celebrations, and an annual employee satisfaction survey<sup>24</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Competitive Remuneration and Development:</strong> Fu Yu consistently reviews and adjusts its remuneration packages to remain competitive in the labor market and ensure fair compensation<sup>25</sup>. Structured training and development programs are implemented to enhance the skills and knowledge of the workforce, aiming to keep employees equipped with the latest expertise<sup>26</sup>. The Group targets an average of 15 hours of training per employee for FY2025<sup>27</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Workforce Stability Focus:</strong> The Group understands that a stable and engaged workforce leads to enhanced operational efficiency, which is critical for its precision engineering business<sup>28</sup>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Sustainability of Performance Trend:</strong><br>
The sustained low employee turnover (if the 24.9% figure is indicative of the underlying performance under the new methodology) is likely sustainable given the Company's stated commitment to employee well-being, competitive remuneration, and ongoing training and development programs<sup>29</sup>. These efforts are foundational to retaining the specialized talent required for high-precision manufacturing. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of these programs will be essential to maintain this trend, especially in a competitive labor market.</p>

<p><strong>Quantify Financial Impact:</strong><br>
While the document does not explicitly quantify the financial impact of employee turnover, a lower turnover rate generally leads to:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> Lower recruitment costs (advertising, interviewing, screening), lower onboarding costs, and reduced training expenses for new hires<sup>30</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Retention of experienced staff leads to higher productivity, fewer errors, and improved efficiency, as skilled workers maintain operational continuity and quality standards in precision manufacturing.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Quality and Customer Satisfaction:</strong> An experienced and stable workforce contributes to consistent product quality, fewer defects, and better customer satisfaction, which can indirectly drive revenue growth and margin stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge Retention:</strong> In a specialized industry like precision manufacturing, retaining skilled employees prevents the loss of critical institutional knowledge and expertise, which is invaluable for innovation and complex project execution.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Due Diligence Questions:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>The reported employee turnover rate dramatically decreased to 24.9% in FY2024. Recognizing the change in reporting methodology from previous years, what specific internal initiatives (e.g., compensation adjustments, training programs, employee engagement activities) have demonstrably contributed to this reduction based on internal tracking metrics, and what is the target turnover rate for FY225 (excluding temporary workers)?</li>
    <li>What is the average tenure of employees in critical high-precision manufacturing roles, and how does the company ensure knowledge transfer and continuity given the specialized nature of its operations?</li>
