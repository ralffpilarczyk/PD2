### b. MD&A Highlighting Key Recent Trends

#### Recent Trends Overview
Maxis' balance sheet demonstrates a relatively stable asset base with a slight increase in total assets in Q1 2025 after a modest decline in FY2024. The company continues to be asset-heavy, dominated by intangible assets (primarily goodwill and spectrum rights) and Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E). A persistent negative working capital position signals reliance on operational cash flows and long-term financing for short-term obligations. Maxis has effectively reduced its net debt in Q1 2025, improving its leverage position.

#### 2 Key Achievements

1.  **Improved Net Debt Position and Leverage Ratio:** Maxis successfully reduced its net debt from RM9,203 million at FY2023 to RM8,825 million at FY2024, and further to RM8,611 million by Q1 2025. This reduction, coupled with stable or growing EBITDA, led to a significant improvement in the Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio, decreasing from 2.32x at FY2023 to 2.14x at FY2024, and further to 2.08x at Q1 2025. This indicates a stronger financial position and enhanced capacity to manage debt, aligning with management's statement of "disciplined approach to capital expenditure, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to support strategic initiatives without compromising financial stability."⁸

    *   Relevant Dates: 31 March 2025, 31 December 2024, 31 December 2023.

2.  **Increased Cash and Equivalents in Q1 2025:** Maxis significantly boosted its cash and equivalents from RM464 million at FY2024 to RM1,231 million in Q1 2025. This substantial increase in liquidity is a positive development, providing greater financial flexibility and resilience in the short term. This aligns with the management's emphasis on "efficient working capital management" contributing to improved operating free cash flow.

    *   Relevant Date: 31 March 2025.

#### 2 Key Challenges

1.  **Persistent Negative Working Capital:** Maxis continues to operate with a substantial negative working capital, standing at (RM1,942) million as of 31 March 2025. While this is an improvement from (RM2,697) million at FY2024, it signifies an ongoing reliance on trade creditors and short-term debt to finance operations. This structure, while common in certain industries like telecommunications due to high deferred revenue and advance payments, poses a liquidity risk if operational cash flows were to significantly decline or if short-term financing becomes constrained. The Current Ratio and Quick Ratio, both at 0.66x in Q1 2025, reinforce this reliance on operational cash flow rather than liquid assets to cover short-term obligations.

    *   Relevant Dates: 31 March 2025, 31 December 2024, 31 December 2023.

2.  **High Concentration of Intangible Assets and PP&E:** A significant portion of Maxis' asset base is tied up in non-current assets, particularly intangible assets (RM10,974 million in Q1 2025) and PP&E (RM4,934 million in Q1 2025). Intangible assets, predominantly goodwill and telecommunications licenses, are subject to impairment risk. While management states that "no impairment is required for goodwill and telecommunications licences,"⁹ their substantial value represents a potential vulnerability if market conditions or regulatory landscapes shift unfavorably. This asset structure limits financial flexibility for rapid reallocation of capital.

#### 2 Observations on Leverage and Covenants

1.  **Healthy Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio and Covenant Compliance:** Maxis' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has consistently improved, reaching 2.08x at Q1 2025 from 2.32x at FY2023. This is well within the typical comfort zone for telecommunication companies and signals effective debt management. Management explicitly states that "These financial covenant ratios have been fully complied with by MBSB for the financial year ended 31 December 2024,"¹⁰ indicating strong adherence to lender requirements. This strong compliance provides stability and access to further financing if needed.

    *   Relevant Dates: 31 March 2025, 31 December 2024, 31 December 2023.

2.  **Strategic Debt Drawdowns and Repayments:** Maxis demonstrates active management of its debt portfolio. In FY2024, the company repaid RM800 million in borrowings while drawing down RM350 million. In Q1 2025, an additional RM450 million was drawn down from an unsecured term loan facility. This strategic approach, as noted by management, "prioritis[es] essential investments" and ensures "resources are allocated effectively to support strategic initiatives." While increasing gross debt slightly in Q1 2025, the overall net debt reduction and strong cash position suggest these drawdowns are for planned capital expenditures or working capital needs, rather than distress.

    *   Relevant Dates: 31 March 2025, 31 December 2024.

#### 2 Observations on Working Capital

1.  **Structural Negative Working Capital, but Improving Trend:** Maxis' working capital remains negative (Current Assets < Current Liabilities) across all observed periods. This is a common characteristic of telcos due to significant deferred revenue (contract liabilities) from prepaid services and device bundles, and large trade payables to vendors. However, the Q1 2025 figure of (RM1,942) million shows a notable improvement from (RM2,697) million at FY2024, primarily driven by a substantial increase in cash and receivables. This suggests better liquidity management in the most recent quarter.
    *   Source: Maxis 25Q1 FS_m.md, page 3, "UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION".
    *   Relevant Dates: 31 March 2025, 31 December 2024, 31 December 2023.

2.  **Reliance on Operational Cash Flow and Payables:** The consistently low current and quick ratios (0.66x and 0.66x respectively in Q1 2025) confirm Maxis' reliance on its strong operating cash flows to meet short-term obligations rather than holding a large buffer of liquid assets. While efficient, this model requires continuous strong operational performance. The large "Payables and accruals" (RM4,216 million in Q1 2025) and "Provisions for liabilities and charges" (RM95 million current portion) highlight the significant short-term obligations that need to be managed through ongoing cash generation.

    *   Relevant Date: 31 March 2025.

#### 2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance

1.  **Service Revenue Growth vs. Device Care Program Impact:** Management's 2025 outlook states "a low single digit growth in service revenue."¹¹ However, the Q1 2025 results show a "decrease of 0.9% YoY" in service revenue, which management attributes to "changes in Maxis Device Care offering."¹² While the underlying service revenue is claimed to be stable, the reported decline creates a disconnect between the forward-looking guidance and immediate performance. The "slight improvement to EBITDA" from this change is noted, suggesting a revenue accounting shift rather than a core business decline, but it still impacts the reported top-line metric.

    *   Relevant Dates: Q1 2025, FY2025 Outlook.

2.  **"Optimise Existing Infrastructure" vs. Continued PP&E Write-offs:** Management consistently highlights "optimising existing infrastructure" and "prioritising Capex investments that align with long-term strategic goals."¹³ While Capex has decreased (RM86 million in Q1 2025 vs RM106 million in Q1 2024), the financial statements continue to show significant "Property, plant and equipment... write-offs" (RM17 million in FY2024, RM4 million in Q1 2025) and "Intangible assets write-off" (RM2 million in FY2024).¹⁴ While some write-offs are normal, their persistence and magnitude could indicate ongoing challenges with asset utilization or strategic shifts requiring early retirement of assets, which is not fully captured in the "optimization" narrative alone.

    *   Relevant Dates: Q1 2025, FY2024.

### c. Off-Balance Sheet Items and Capital Commitments

Maxis' financial statements also provide insights into potential future obligations and commitments not fully reflected on the balance sheet.

1.  **Contingent Liabilities:** As of 31 March 2025, Maxis has contingent liabilities arising from "legal recourse sought by the Group's customers or vendors and indemnities given to financial institutions on bank guarantees."¹⁵ While the company anticipates "no material losses" from these transactions, their existence represents potential future cash outflows if adverse events occur. This is a standard disclosure for companies, but it highlights an area of potential, albeit currently unquantified, financial exposure.
    *   Source: Maxis 25Q1 FS_m.md, page 11, "Note 12: Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets".
    *   Relevant Date: 31 March 2025.

2.  **Capital Commitments:** Maxis has significant capital expenditure commitments that are contracted for but not yet recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. As of 31 March 2025, these commitments for "Property, plant and equipment" amounted to RM294 million.¹⁶ This figure indicates planned future investments in infrastructure and assets, which will require funding and impact future cash flows, even though they are not current obligations. This is a decrease from RM377 million at FY2024, aligning with management's narrative of disciplined capital expenditure.
