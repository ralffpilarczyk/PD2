### d. Beneficial Ownership Information and Related Shareholder Groups

The substantial shareholding of 62.24% in Maxis Berhad is held by BGSM Equity Holdings Sdn. Bhd., which is ultimately controlled by a joint venture among three key groups:

*   **Ananda Krishnan (via PanOcean Management Limited and Usaha Tegas Sdn. Bhd.):** PanOcean Management Limited (PanOcean) is the trustee of a discretionary trust whose beneficiaries include members of the family of the late Ananda Krishnan Tatparanandam (TAK) and foundations for charitable purposes. PanOcean, through its subsidiaries (Excorp Holdings N.V., Pacific States Investment Limited, and Usaha Tegas Sdn. Bhd. (UTSB)), holds a deemed interest in 62.24% of Maxis shares. It's important to note that while PanOcean and TAK's estate are "deemed" to have an interest, they do not have direct economic or beneficial interest, as such interest is held subject to the terms of the discretionary trust.

### f. Shareholder Activism History

The provided documents do not explicitly mention any history of shareholder activism, proxy contests, or significant public disputes with shareholders. Maxis emphasizes its commitment to transparent and consistent communication with stakeholders, including shareholders, through various channels such as annual general meetings, analyst briefings, investor community engagements, and its investor relations website. This suggests a proactive approach to managing shareholder relations, aiming to prevent adversarial situations.

### g. Voting Power Distribution and Control Implications

The voting power distribution in Maxis Berhad is highly concentrated, with the ultimate holding company, BGSM, holding a substantial 62.24% of the issued shares. Given that each ordinary share carries one vote, this effectively grants BGSM (and its joint controllers) de facto control over the company.

*   **Control Implications:**
    *   **Strategic Direction:** The majority shareholder group has the power to determine the strategic direction, major investments, and significant corporate actions of Maxis.
    *   **Board Composition:** They largely influence the appointment and removal of directors, ensuring alignment with their interests.
    *   **Dividend Policy:** While the Board declares dividends, the majority shareholder's influence on the Board ensures alignment with their expectations for shareholder returns.
    *   **Stability:** This concentrated ownership can provide stability to the company's long-term planning and operations, as major decisions are less likely to be disrupted by dispersed minority interests.
    *   **Minority Shareholder Influence:** While institutional investors like EPF (with over 12% total interest) are significant, their voting power is substantially less than the controlling group, limiting their ability to unilaterally oppose major resolutions. Their influence would likely come from engagement and persuasion rather than direct voting power.

### h. Shareholder Agreements and Key Terms

*   **Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) Shareholders' Agreement:** Maxis Broadband Sdn. Bhd. (MBSB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maxis, entered into a conditional share subscription agreement (SSA) with DNB and Minister of Finance, Incorporated (MoF Inc) on December 1, 2023. This agreement, completed on June 28, 2024, involved MBSB subscribing for an equity stake in DNB (0.02% ownership) and a prepayment of RM233,233,333 for products and services.
    *   **Key Terms:**
        *   The prepayment is treated as **shareholder advances** to DNB, carrying voting rights (each RM1 of Shareholder Advance entitles one vote). These advances are interest-free and not repayable on demand.
        *   The Shareholders' Agreement outlines terms for the transition to a dual 5G network model.
        *   It includes **put options** for MoF Inc. to sell its DNB shares and transfer its loan to Investor Shareholders (including Maxis).
        *   It also includes **call options** for Investor Shareholders to acquire MoF Inc.'s stake if the put option is not exercised.
        *   An equity restructuring exercise is planned after these options are completed, potentially leading to a split between shareholders remaining in DNB and those forming a second 5G network entity.
        *   As of December 31, 2024, none of these options had been exercised.

### Critical Stance and Business Insights

The ownership structure of Maxis Berhad is dominated by a single, large block of shares held by BGSM Equity Holdings Sdn. Bhd. This concentration of ownership provides a high degree of stability in strategic decision-making, which can be beneficial for long-term investments characteristic of the telecommunications industry. The layers of beneficial ownership, tracing back to entities linked to the late Ananda Krishnan, Saudi Telecom Company (PIF), and Harapan Nusantara (Bumiputera trusts), highlight the strategic national and international interests underpinning Maxis's control.

However, such a concentrated structure, while providing stability, also implies limited influence for minority shareholders. The absence of direct shareholdings by Maxis's own Board of Directors (excluding the CEO's incentive-based indirect holdings) is noteworthy. While this might suggest an emphasis on independent oversight, it also means the Board's personal financial alignment with common shareholders' interests is not through direct equity ownership. The CEO's shareholdings are entirely indirect and linked to long-term incentive plans, aligning his interests with future company performance rather than immediate share price fluctuations.

The company's regular issuance of shares under its Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) indicates a commitment to employee retention and motivation, though the scale of these issuances is minor relative to the total issued share capital, thus not significantly diluting major shareholders' control.

The DNB shareholder agreement is a critical development, signaling Maxis's strategic positioning in the evolving 5G landscape. The complex put and call options highlight the ongoing negotiations and uncertainties surrounding the dual 5G network model in Malaysia. The fact that Maxis has a voting stake in DNB through its shareholder advances, despite a minimal equity ownership, is a key detail that could influence its future 5G strategy and competitive positioning. The outcome of these options and the dual network implementation will be crucial for Maxis's long-term operational and financial performance, and thus, indirectly, its shareholder value. Management's commentary on "exploring all avenues to enhance our 5G offerings" and "actively engage with stakeholders to shape our long-term 5G strategy" (Maxis 24 AR, p. 7, "CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT") should be viewed in light of these complex DNB agreements and the potential for a new competitive landscape. The recent announcement of U Mobile building the second 5G network (Maxis 24 AR, p. 150) implies Maxis will likely remain as an "Investor Shareholder" in DNB, utilizing DNB's network, rather than becoming the operator of a second network itself. This could reduce capital expenditure risk but potentially impact competitive differentiation in the long run.
