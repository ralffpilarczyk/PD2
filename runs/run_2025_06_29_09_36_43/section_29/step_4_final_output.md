#### 1. Manufacturing Revenue Growth & Geographical Mix

*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - derived semi-annually):**

    | Metric                                | 1H2023 | 2H23   | FY2023 | 1H2024 | 2H24   | FY2024 |
    | :------------------------------------ | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
    | **Manufacturing Revenue (S$M)**       | 52.6   | 51.3   | 103.9  | 54.8   | 60.1   | 114.9  |
    | **Growth (YoY%)**                     |        |        |        | 4.2%   | 17.2%  | 10.5%  |
    | **Geographical Contribution (S$M)**   |        |        |        |        |        |        |
    | Singapore                             | 19.7   | 18.5   | 38.2   | 21.0   | 25.2   | 46.2   |
    | Malaysia                              | 12.8   | 16.5   | 29.3   | 17.8   | 18.8   | 36.6   |
    | China                                 | 20.1   | 16.3   | 36.4   | 16.0   | 16.1   | 32.1   |

    *Sources: FY2024 Annual Report, FY2024 Q4 Unaudited Financial Statements, 1H2024 Results Briefing Presentation.*

*   **Benchmarking:** Documents lack specific revenue or market share data for competitors or industry growth rates. Critical: prevents assessing if 10.5% growth is excellent, average, or underperforming for a high-precision pivot. Market share judgment impossible.

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** Manufacturing revenue grew 10.5% in FY2024 (17.2% in 2H2024) from higher order volumes and new biomedical/consumer projects. Clarify if growth is new customers, expanded existing, or one-off, impacting sustainability. China revenue declined 11.8% ('slower-than-expected recovery'). Investigate if due to market, competitive losses, or strategic de-emphasis.

*   **Quantify Financial Impact:** 10.5% manufacturing growth drove Group's 0.5% revenue increase, offsetting S$10M SCM decline and narrowing net loss from S$10.1M (FY2023) to S$3.9M (FY2024).

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    *   To what extent does the recent increase in order volumes reflect new customers versus increased orders from existing customers, and what are typical contract durations/renewal rates for high-precision manufacturing projects, particularly in the biomedical segment?
    *   Given the decline in China operations revenue, what specific market or competitive conditions led to this underperformance, and what is the long-term strategy for regaining or stabilizing market share beyond a "China-for-China" focus?

#### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - derived semi-annually):**

    | Metric                         | 1H2023 | 2H23   | FY2023 | 1H2024 | 2H24   | FY2024 |
    | :----------------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
    | **Manufacturing GPM (%)**      | 11.85% | 11.57% | 11.7%  | 12.86% | 14.10% | 13.5%  |
    | **Change (ppt vs. prior H/FY)** |        |        |        | +1.01  | +2.53  | +1.8   |

    *Sources: FY2024 Annual Report, FY2024 Q4 Unaudited Financial Statements, 1H2024 Results Briefing Presentation.*

*   **Benchmarking:** No competitor GPM or industry averages. Critical omission: impossible to judge if 13.5% is healthy/sustainable for 'high-precision manufacturing' or lags peers. What constitutes 'best-in-class' GPM?

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** GPM improved from 11.7% (FY2023) to 13.5% (FY2024) via strategic shift to 'high-precision manufacturing' and 'higher-margin product categories.' Quantify mix shift vs. granular cost efficiencies. 'Lower employee, travel, utility, sundry expenses' cited. Differentiate sustainable structural improvements (automation, supply chain) vs. one-off savings. Demand granular breakdown of cost reductions and initiatives.

*   **Quantify Financial Impact:** 1.8 percentage point GPM increase generated S$2.7M additional gross profit, significantly contributing to 27.5% increase in manufacturing gross profit and narrowing Group's net loss.

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    *   Can management provide a breakdown of gross profit margins by key product categories (e.g., biomedical, consumer, automotive, industrial) and highlight which categories drove the most significant margin expansion in FY2024?
    *   What specific cost-containment measures, particularly regarding employee, utility, and sundry expenses, are considered sustainable, and what is the potential impact of rising raw material costs on future GPM, including any hedging strategies?

#### 3. Energy Intensity (Manufacturing Segment)

*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - Annually):**

    | Metric                                | FY2023    | FY2024    | Change (YoY%) |
    | :------------------------------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ |
    | **Total Energy Consumed (GJ)**        | 118,698.7 | 119,942.0 | +1.1%         |
    | **Manufacturing Revenue (S$M)**       | 103.9     | 114.9     | +10.5%        |
    | **Energy Intensity (GJ/S$M Revenue)** | 1,142.4   | 1,044.0   | -8.6%         |

    *Sources: FY2024 Sustainability Report, FY2024 Annual Report.*

    *Note: Only annual data for energy consumption and intensity is available, limiting granular trend analysis.*

*   **Benchmarking:** No industry-specific energy intensity benchmarks for precision plastic/metal component manufacturing. Crucial for ESG assessment: how does Fu Yu compare to peers in efficiency? Relevant for operational excellence and ESG risk management.

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** Despite 1.1% absolute energy consumption increase, Fu Yu improved energy intensity by 8.6% in FY2024 (more revenue per unit energy). Drivers: energy-efficient machines, LED lighting, solar panels. GHG Emissions Intensity also decreased. Ongoing Industry 4.0 investments and renewable energy integration (solar panel completion in Malaysia by 2Q2025) suggest sustainability.

*   **Quantify Financial Impact:** While cost savings are embedded, *must* quantify *specific monetary savings* from this 8.6% improvement. 'Part of broader reduction in water and electricity charges' is insufficient. A precise dollar value saved directly demonstrates ROI on capex and contribution to profit/GPM. This impact is largely unquantified.

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    *   What is the specific capital expenditure allocated to energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives for FY2025, and what are the projected cost savings and ROI from these investments?
    *   How does the Company's energy consumption (absolute and intensity) vary with production volume fluctuations, particularly at lower utilization rates, and what measures are in place to maintain efficiency during such periods?

### Overarching Concerns for Buyside Due Diligence

Beyond the individual metrics, several critical areas remain unaddressed or under-scrutinized, essential for a comprehensive buyside assessment:

1.  **The Unaddressed "Critical Shadow": Supply Chain Management Services Segment & Ongoing Investigation**
    The SCM segment's cessation and 'ongoing investigation into its past affairs' is a glaring omission impacting valuation, legal risk, and reputation. Buyside *must* delve into:
    *   **Nature:** Specifics (e.g., fraud)? Impacts financial reporting/management.
    *   **Liabilities:** Estimated financial liabilities (fines, legal costs, clawbacks)? Taints entire company or isolated?
    *   **Historical Contribution:** SCM's past contribution to *total group gross profit, net profit, and cash flow*? Cessation likely created a significant profitability/cash flow hole for manufacturing to fill, beyond the S$10M revenue decline. Without this, manufacturing recovery assessment is incomplete.

2.  **Working Capital and Capital Expenditure Analysis:**
    Strategic pivot demands significant working capital analysis: cash conversion cycle, AR/AP, inventory. Substantial capex for 'advanced tooling' and 'Industry 4.0 machinery' needs scrutiny: funding, ROI, financing ability, especially given ongoing net losses.

3.  **Management & Governance Assessment:**
    Given the strategic pivot and SCM investigation, buyside *must* assess management capabilities to execute new strategy and overall corporate governance. Leadership integrity and stability are paramount.
