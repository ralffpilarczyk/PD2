<h3>c. Disconnects Between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies</h3>

<p>While Fu Yu's corporate strategies largely support its strategic objectives, one area shows a short-term gap:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability Performance:</strong> The strategic objective of reducing Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% by has a short-term target of 3.0% for . However, the Group only achieved a 1.4% reduction in Scope 2 carbon emissions in , falling short of this short-term target | <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.41]</sup>. While the corporate strategy includes relevant initiatives like installing solar panels | <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.6]</sup> and exploring cleaner energy solutions | <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.16]</sup>, the pace or scale of these current strategic actions (e.g., solar panel initiatives extending into | <sup>[Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, p.47]</sup>) did not fully align with the ambitious immediate objective, leading to the reported shortfall. This indicates a potential disconnect between the current efficacy of the strategy and the short-term goal.</li>
