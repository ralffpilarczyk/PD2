### 2. Diversified Customer Base & "Sticky" High-Value Projects

**Description:** Fu Yu benefits from an established, diverse, and loyal customer base spanning multiple critical sectors, with a growing focus on high-growth, high-precision projects. The nature of these projects ensures recurring, long-term revenue streams due to the specialized tooling involved.

**Qualitative Advantages:**
*   **Broad Industry Exposure:** The Company serves an "international, diverse and loyal customer base across the life sciences, medical, consumer, automotive and industrial sectors"<sup>9</sup>, diversifying its revenue streams and reducing reliance on any single industry.
*   **New Project Wins & High-Growth Segments:** In FY2024, Fu Yu "secured new projects across a broad spectrum of industries, including medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances"<sup>10</sup>, expanding into innovative and high-growth areas. Its "refreshed customer base now includes global leaders in wound care and personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines"<sup>10</sup>.
*   **"Sticky" Customer Relationships:** The "relatively 'sticky' nature of projects involving high-precision tooling"<sup>3</sup> means that once a customer invests in bespoke tooling with Fu Yu, they are likely to continue production with the Company. This "translates into long-term sustainable revenue"<sup>3</sup> and ensures customer loyalty.

**Quantitative Measures & Financial Impact:**
*   **Strong Revenue Growth from Manufacturing:** Revenue from continuing manufacturing operations grew by **10.5% to S$114.9 million in FY2024** from S$103.9 million in FY2023<sup>7</sup>, driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers, as well as new projects secured"<sup>5</sup>.
*   **Significant Order Book Expansion:** As at the end of FY2024, Fu Yu's "order book... increased 20% year-on-year"<sup>3</sup>, providing clear visibility on future revenue. This is "expected to contribute positively to financial performance for FY2025"<sup>11</sup>.
*   **Regional Growth in Key Segments:** The Company saw strong growth in its profitable regions, with Singapore manufacturing sales up **20.9% to S$46.2 million in FY2024** (from S$38.2 million in FY2023) and Malaysia sales up **24.9% to S$36.6 million in FY2024** (from S$29.3 million in FY2023), primarily due to "higher sales in the medical and consumer segments"<sup>12,13</sup>. This regional growth significantly contributed to the manufacturing segment's turnaround in Profit Before Tax (PBT) in Singapore (S$1.2 million PBT in FY2024, sharply reversing a S$6.9 million Loss Before Tax in FY2023)<sup>12</sup>.

This diversified, high-value, and inherently "sticky" customer base provides Fu Yu with a resilient and growing revenue foundation, distinguishing it from competitors with more concentrated or transactional revenue streams.

### 3. Geographical Flexibility & Supply Chain Resilience

**Description:** Fu Yu's strategic presence across three key manufacturing geographies (Singapore, Malaysia, and China) and its Singapore headquarters provide customers with critical supply chain flexibility, particularly amidst global geopolitical uncertainties. This allows the Company to offer alternative production locations, mitigating single-country risks.

**Qualitative Advantages:**
*   **Mitigating Geopolitical Risk:** The Company explicitly notes that "amid geopolitical uncertainty, more customers seek to source production away from China"<sup>3</sup>. As a "Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company with production in three countries," Fu Yu can "offer geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty"<sup>3</sup>.
*   **Adaptive Supply Chain:** The flexibility allows Fu Yu to "diversify its suppliers globally"<sup>14</sup>, further enhancing resilience against disruptions, which is a key concern for global clients. The Company acknowledges that "revenue contribution by location will continue to evolve over the next few years"<sup>3</sup>, demonstrating its proactive adaptation.

**Quantitative Measures & Financial Impact:**
*   **Shifting Revenue Mix:** While China operations' contribution to total manufacturing revenue reduced by **7.1 percentage points to 27.9% in FY2024** (from 35.0% in FY2023), the Company successfully compensated for this shift with strong growth in other regions<sup>5</sup>. This demonstrates successful redirection and capture of demand in alternative locations.
*   **Sustained Manufacturing Growth:** Despite headwinds in China's economy (which led to an 11.8% decline in China manufacturing revenue in FY2024)<sup>15</sup>, the overall manufacturing segment revenue still achieved a robust **10.5% growth in FY2024**<sup>7</sup>, primarily driven by Singapore and Malaysia. This highlights the effectiveness of its multi-country strategy in maintaining top-line performance.
*   **Overall Profitability Improvement:** This adaptability contributes to the overall improved financial performance of the continuing operations, with the Group's Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) from continuing operations increasing "more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million in FY2024 from S$0.6 million in FY2023"<sup>7</sup>, and the net loss narrowing sharply.

This unique ability to offer geographical alternatives for production provides Fu Yu with a significant competitive edge in attracting and retaining global customers seeking de-risked supply chains, contributing to sustained revenue and improved financial stability in a volatile global landscape.
