*   **Benchmark:** No direct competitor or industry-specific volume data is provided in the available documents for benchmarking.
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The growth in manufacturing revenue, particularly the 10.6% increase in FY2024, was primarily driven by "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments." This success is attributed to the Company's "strategic transformation," including investments in advanced tooling and the establishment of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. The Company's diversification strategy away from China is evident, with strong growth in Singapore and Malaysia offsetting a decline in China due to a slower economic recovery [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 8].
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The increasing trend in manufacturing revenue appears sustainable in the short-to-medium term. The Company reports a "20% year-on-year increase in order book at the end of FY2024" and notes that several high-precision projects are "now ready for mass production," expected to translate into "long-term sustainable revenue" due to their "sticky nature" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. However, external factors such as geopolitical uncertainties and potential supply chain disruptions [Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, Page 13] could impact future volume stability.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The S$11.0 million (10.6%) increase in manufacturing revenue from FY2023 to FY2024 was a crucial factor in the significant reduction of the Group's net loss. This volume growth provides the necessary scale for operational leverage and supports the overall financial turnaround.
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of the 20% year-on-year order book increase by customer and product category to substantiate the expected revenue realization in FY2025?
    2.  What is the sales pipeline for new manufacturing projects beyond the current order book, particularly for the high-precision offerings from the Smart Factory, to assess long-term volume sustainability?

**2. Gross Profit Margin (Manufacturing Segment)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Gross Profit Margin (GPM) in the manufacturing segment indicates the profitability of each unit of production, reflecting pricing power, cost of raw materials, and production efficiency. As a "unit margin" proxy, it directly impacts the Company's overall profitability, signaling its ability to command premium prices or control production costs.
*   **Historical Data (Manufacturing Segment GPM):**

    | Period | Gross Profit (S$M) | Revenue (S$M) | GPM (%) |
    | :----- | :----------------- | :------------ | :------ |
    | 1H2023 | 6.2                | 52.6          | 11.8%   |
    | 2H2023 | 5.9                | 51.3          | 11.6%   |
    | FY2023 | 12.1               | 103.9         | 11.7%   |
    | 1H2024 | 7.0                | 54.8          | 12.9%   |
    | 2H2024 | 8.5                | 60.1          | 14.1%   |
    | FY2024 | 15.5               | 114.9         | 13.5%   |

*   **Benchmark:** No direct competitor or industry-specific GPM benchmarks are provided in the available documents.
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The manufacturing segment's GPM improved by 1.8 percentage points from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024. This was primarily driven by the "higher topline" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5] and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" which are noted as "higher-margin product categories" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 5]. Additionally, lower selling and administrative expenses [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7] contributed to overall profitability, indicating some operational efficiency gains beyond direct cost of sales.
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The upward trend in GPM appears sustainable as the Company continues to focus on higher-precision and higher-value product lines. The strategic shift to advanced tooling and the NPI team are expected to bolster this trend. However, potential increases in raw material costs and energy prices [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 31] could pose risks to sustaining current margin levels.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** The improved GPM contributed significantly to the manufacturing segment's gross profit increase of S$3.4 million (from S$12.1 million in FY2023 to S$15.5 million in FY2024) [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7]. This margin expansion was a key factor in narrowing the net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million in FY2023 to S$1.2 million in FY2024 [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 7].
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  What is the average Gross Profit Margin target for the new high-precision projects, and how do these compare to the historical average GPM of existing projects to validate the sustained margin expansion strategy?
    2.  Can the Company detail its hedging strategies for critical raw material inputs and foreign currency exposures to mitigate potential future cost increases that could compress manufacturing margins?

**3. Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Manufacturing Revenue)**

*   **Definition and Relevance:** Energy intensity measures the total energy consumed (in Gigajoules, GJ) per million Singapore Dollars (S$) of manufacturing revenue. This metric serves as a key indicator of asset utilization efficiency and operational effectiveness, reflecting how efficiently the Company converts energy inputs into economic output. A lower energy intensity signifies improved cost control and a reduced environmental footprint.
*   **Historical Data (Group-wide Energy Consumption, Manufacturing Revenue as Denominator):**

    | Period | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue) |
    | :----- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
    | FY2023 | 118,698.7                  | 103.9                              | 1,142.4                              |
    | FY2024 | 119,942.0                  | 114.9                              | 1,044.0                              |
    *Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38, "Energy Consumption (GJ)" and "Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue)". FY2023 Total Energy calculated from components: Electricity 116,481.6 GJ + Diesel 1,641.5 GJ + Petrol 575.6 GJ.*

*   **Benchmark:** No industry-specific energy intensity benchmarks are provided in the available documents.
*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The 8.5% improvement in energy intensity from 1,142.4 GJ/S$'mil in FY2023 to 1,044.0 GJ/S$'mil in FY2024 reflects enhanced operational efficiency. Key drivers include investments in "energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines" and upgrading "existing lighting with more efficient LED lighting" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38]. Additionally, the Company is implementing operational optimizations such as "optimise production planning to reduce machinery idling time" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 38] and integrating solar panels into its energy mix, reducing reliance on grid electricity [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 47].
*   **Sustainability of Trend:** The trend of improving energy intensity appears sustainable, underpinned by the Company's ongoing CapEx for energy-efficient machinery and the phased implementation of renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar panels in Malaysia operational in 2H2024 and 2Q2025) [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 47]. This commitment to reducing "carbon emissions" and exploring "cleaner energy solutions" [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 17] suggests a long-term focus on efficiency. However, the rising cost of electricity and the introduction of carbon taxes [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, Page 31] necessitate continuous efficiency gains to mitigate increased operational expenses.
*   **Quantified Financial Impact:** While not explicitly quantified as a standalone financial impact, the reduction in energy intensity directly contributes to cost savings in the cost of goods sold. This improved efficiency per unit of revenue supports the overall margin expansion and helps to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, thereby improving the profitability of the manufacturing segment.
*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    1.  Can the Company provide a breakdown of projected energy cost savings in FY2025 resulting from efficiency investments and renewable energy installations completed in FY2024 and those expected in 1H2025?
    2.  What is the Group's long-term target for energy intensity reduction (e.g., for FY2026 and FY2027), and what is the strategic roadmap for achieving these targets, particularly regarding further automation and Industry 4.0 adoption in the Smart Factory?
