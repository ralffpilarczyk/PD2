### E Selected notes to the condensed interim financial statements

# 1. Corporate Information

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Company") is incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and whose shares are publicly traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange.

These condensed interim financial statements as at and for the six months ("2H24") and full year ended 31 December 2024 ("FY2024") comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group").

The principal activities of the Company are those of manufacturing and sub-assembly of precision plastic parts and components, fabrication of precision moulds and dies and investment holding. The principal activities of the Company's subsidiaries consist of (i) manufacturing and sub-assembly of precision plastic parts and components, fabrication of precision moulds and dies, trading, provision of management services and investment holding and (ii) providing supply chain management services and commodity raw materials. The Group ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") in last quarter of FY2024.

## 2. Basis of Preparation

## 2.1. Statement of compliance

The condensed interim financial statements for the six months and full year ended 31 December 2024 have been prepared in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-34 Interim Financial Reporting issued by the Accounting Standards Council Singapore. The condensed interim financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year which were prepared in accordance with SFRS(I)s, except for the adoption of new and amended standards as set out in Note 2.5.

#### 2.2. Basis of measurement

The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value or amortised cost.

#### 2.3. Functional and presentation currency

The condensed interim financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars (\$) which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented in Singapore dollars has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.

# 2.4. Use of judgements and estimates

The preparation of the condensed interim financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next interim period are included in the following note:

- Note 3 measurement of recoverable amounts of PPE
- Note 5 impairment test of goodwill: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts
- Note 6 and 7 recoverability of investments in and amounts due from subsidiaries
- Note 7 measurement of expected credit losses (ECL) allowance for trade and other receivables

Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the condensed interim financial statements is included in the following note:

Note 4 – classification of investment property

# Measurement of fair values

A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures requires the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).

Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:

Note 15 – financial risk management: accounting classification and fair value

# 2.5. New and amended standards adopted by the Group

There has been no change in the accounting policies and methods of computation adopted by the Group for the current reporting period compared with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for the adoption of new or revised SFRS(I) and Interpretations of SFRS(I) ("INT SFRS(I)") that are mandatory for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

The adoption of these SFRS(I) and INT SFRS(I) has no significant impact on the Group.

## 3. Property, plant and equipment

During the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Group acquired assets amounting to \$9,389,000 (31 Dec 2023: \$4,886,000) of which \$2,449,000 (31 Dec 2023: \$1,150,000) relates to right-of-use assets and disposed of assets amounting to net book value of \$186,000. (31 Dec 2023: \$1,500).

As at 31 December 2024, the cost incurred for redevelopment project in Singapore amounting to \$Nil (31 Dec 2023: \$21,046,000). Included in this amount are the capitalised borrowing costs related to the construction of the factory of \$Nil (2023: \$266,000).

# 4. Investment property

|                             | Group  |
|-----------------------------|--------|
|                             | \$'000 |
| Cost                        |        |
| At 1 January 2023           | 8,643  |
| Currency realignment        | (499)  |
| At 31 December 2023         | 8,144  |
| Currency realignment        | 491    |
| At 31 December 2024         | 8,635  |
| Accumulated depreciation    |        |
| At 1 January 2023           | 2,505  |
| Depreciation for the year   | 135    |
| Currency realignment        | (148)  |
| At 31 December 2023         | 2,492  |
| Depreciation for the period | 145    |
| Currency realignment        | 156    |
| At 31 December 2024         | 2,793  |
| Carrying amounts            |        |
| At 31 December 2023         | 5,652  |
| At 31 December 2024         | 5,842  |
|                             |        |

The buildings are leased to a third party.

External valuation of the investment property is conducted at least once a year. The fair value of the investment property (fair value hierarchy of level 3) as at 31 December 2024 amounts to approximately \$7,158,000 (2023: \$6,751,000) and has been determined based on valuations performed by accredited independent valuers with recent experience in the location and category of investment properties being valued. The valuations are based on comparison method and the depreciated replacement cost method. The depreciated replacement cost method makes reference to the cost of replacing the buildings as new and allowing for depreciation. Key unobservable inputs correspond to replacement costs having regard to asset life, physical deterioration, functional and economic obsolescence. The comparison method involves comparing and adopting recent transactions as a yardstick and sale evidences involving other similar properties in the vicinity. The Group has assessed that the best use of its properties does not differ from their current use.

The Group has certain leasehold land held to earn rental income and also for own production or supply of goods and administrative purposes. If a portion of the property cannot be sold or leased out separately under a finance lease, the entire property is classified as investment property only if the portion of the property held for own use is insignificant. Judgement is involved in determining the allocation of investment property and property, plant and equipment.

### 5. Goodwill

|                      | Group   |
|----------------------|---------|
|                      | \$'000  |
| Cost                 |         |
| At 1 January 2024    | 3,185   |
| Impairment loss      | (3,286) |
| Currency realignment | 101     |
| At 31 December 2024  | –       |

## Impairment testing for cash generating unit ("CGU") containing goodwill

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the Group's supply chain management services and commodity raw materials CGU.

The recoverable amount of this CGU was based on fair value less costs of disposal approach, applying the adjusted net asset method.

As at 31 December 2024, this CGU has ceased business activities in the last quarter of FY2024, and is not expected to resume business operations in the near future, hence, we classify it as discontinued operations, see note 15.

#### Impairment assessment

Subsidiaries in China incurred operating losses and had shown indication that impairment loss recognised in prior years may no longer be appropriate. Accordingly, the Company performed an assessment of the recoverable amount of its investments in these 3 subsidiaries. The recoverable amounts of investments in subsidiaries were estimated based on the fair value less costs to sell ("FVLCTS") method.

Management determined the recoverable amounts of investments in these subsidiaries based on FVLCTS method. The fair value is estimated based on the fair value of the leasehold properties and machineries determined by independent valuers with experience in the location and category of the assets being valued.

#### Expected credit loss ("ECL") assessment

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables and contract assets which comprise a large number of small balances, while for other receivables there is no significant increase in credit risk for these exposures, therefore impairment has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and the amount of the allowance is insignificant.

Loss rates are estimated based on actual credit loss experience over the past five years. These rates are adjusted to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected life of the receivables.

There have been no significant changes to the movement in the allowance for impairment loss in respect of trade and other receivables during the period.

The non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries are unsecured, non-interest bearing and are amounts lent to subsidiaries companies to satisfy funding requirements.

The current amounts due from subsidiaries are unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.

The Company applies the general approach for expected credit loss model to measure the loss allowance on the amount due from subsidiaries. Due to the economic uncertainty in the current and future economic environment, the Company concluded that there has been significant increase in the credit risk expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (lifetime ECL).

#### 14. Operating Segments

The Group has the following two strategic divisions, which are its reportable segments. These divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies.

- Manufacturing Segment
- Supply Chain Management Services Segment

Within the manufacturing segment, the Group has three reportable segments which are geographical segments and are based on the location of assets, namely Singapore, Malaysia and China. These geographical segments are managed separately because they bear different financial and business risks. The locations of the Group's customers are not significantly different from the locations of the Group's assets.

Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Performance is measured based on (loss)/ profit before income tax, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and investment property, finance costs and net foreign exchange gain/(loss) as included in internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group's Chief Executive Officer (chief operating decision maker). Such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within the Group's industry. Both intersegment and intra-segment pricing are based on terms agreed by the counterparties.

The entire results of Supply Chain Management Services Segment was presented separately on the Condensed interim consolidated income statement as "Discontinued operations" for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.

# 15. Discontinued Operations

The Group has made the decision to discontinue the operation of Supply Chain Management Services Segment due to the inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business. Despite extensive efforts to find a qualified individual with the necessary skills and vision, the company has not been able to secure leadership that aligns with its strategic goals. As a result, the management team has concluded that discontinuing operations is the most prudent course of action.

The supply chain management services segment was not previously presented as a discontinued operation as at 31 December 2023. Thus, the comparative statement of profit or loss has been represented to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.

To achieve this presentation, management has eliminated from the results of the discontinued operation the inter-company costs during the year.

#### 16. Financial Risk Management

#### Accounting classification and fair values

The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities (including trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, trade and other payables and unsecured bank loans) are assumed to approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity or re-pricing. Further, the fair value disclosure of lease liabilities is also not required.

Sales from Singapore operations improved 20.9% to S\$46.2 million in FY2024 from S\$38.2 million a year ago, mainly due to higher sales in the medical segment and consumer segment.

# 10. A commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industry in which the group operates and any known factors or events that may affect the group in the next reporting period and the next 12 months

The Group has been focused on strengthening its manufacturing capabilities to secure new customers and improve operational efficiency, even as it navigates a challenging operating environment. Reflecting these efforts, the Group recorded better margins and sharply narrowed its net loss to S\$3.9 million in FY2024 from a net loss of S\$10.1 million in FY2023. EBITDA from continuing operations increased to S\$8.5 million in FY2024 from S\$0.6 million in FY2023.

In 2H2024, the Group's core manufacturing division secured several new projects from customers in the medical and consumer segments. Having completed the initial stages of prototyping, design iterations and mould development, which span several months, the Group has commenced mass production for its customers, which will translate into long-term sustainable revenue for the coming years.

Combined with higher order volumes and interest to increasing order volumes from existing customers, the Group's order book is expected to increase 20% year-on-year, and contribute positively to financial performance for FY2025.

Meanwhile, the Group is focused on building a strong pipeline of projects, leveraging on the advanced capabilities at its Smart Factory in Singapore. Having completed its internal re-tooling and transformation, the Group is proactively pursuing projects for high-precision products.

The Group ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") in last quarter of FY2024, to reallocate resources to emphasise its key manufacturing capabilities to meet anticipated demand. As announced on 31 January 2025, Fu Yu has commenced investigations into the affairs of FYSCS; the ongoing inquiry is isolated only to FYSCS, and does not impact core manufacturing operations.

The cessation will allow the Group to reallocate resources, sharpening its focus on its core manufacturing business. Concurrently, the Group will continue to implement cost-containment measures to maintain its competitiveness amid economic and geopolitical uncertainties.

Building upon this foundation, the Group remains optimistic that financial performance for FY2025 will improve compared to FY2024, barring unforeseen circumstances.
