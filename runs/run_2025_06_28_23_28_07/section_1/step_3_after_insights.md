## SECTION 1: Operating Footprint Analysis

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group"), an established manufacturer of high-end precision plastic and metal components, strategically distributes its physical and human resources across Asia to support its vertically-integrated business model and international customer base.

### a. Employee Distribution Across Locations and Functions

The Group's total workforce has declined over the last three years, from 1,535 employees in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024. This trend reflects strategic adjustments, including the cessation of its supply chain management services segment.

**Employee Headcount Trends (Annual)**

| Metric               | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Source                                |
| :------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :------------------------------------ |
| Total Employees      | 1,372  | 1,488  | 1,535  | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"]  |
| Permanent Employees  | 1,241  | N/A    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 48, "Employment"]  |
| Temporary Employees  | 131    | N/A    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 48, "Employment"]  |
| New Hire Rate        | 26.7%  | 60.7%  | 57.4%  | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49-50, "Employment"] |
| Turnover Rate        | 24.9%  | 63.8%  | 59.7%  | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 51, "Employment"]  |

*Note: FY2024 employee numbers exclude outsourced workers, impacting direct comparability. New hire and turnover rates for FY2022 & FY2023 were restated for GRI alignment. Data for "Permanent/Temporary Employees" is only available for FY2024 in the provided source. Historical annual data for all metrics is provided where available.*
*Disclaimer: Employee data by specific functions (e.g., manufacturing, R&D, sales, administrative) and consistent quarterly interim data across all employee metrics are not explicitly reported in the primary source documents for the requested periods.*

**Employee Distribution by Region (Headcount)**

| Region    | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 | Source                               |
| :-------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----------------------------------- |
| Singapore | 484    | 429    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"] |
| Malaysia  | 358    | 365    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"] |
| China     | 530    | 694    | N/A    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 49, "Employment"] |

The rise in Singapore's workforce (484 in FY2024 vs. 429 in FY2023) alongside a substantial reduction in China (from 694 to 530) aligns with the Group's stated strategy to pivot manufacturing away from China. The significant new hire rate in Singapore (44.4%) compared to China (9.1%) in FY2024 further underscores this shift, supporting the growth of its Smart Factory and biomedical segment in Singapore.

However, the persistently high turnover rates (even after the FYSCS adjustment in FY24, still 24.9%) are deeply concerning. Turnover rates of 25%+ in manufacturing often indicate issues with compensation, working conditions, morale, or management, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge, increased training costs, and potential quality control challenges. The explicit note that FY2024 numbers "exclude outsourced workers, impacting direct comparability" fundamentally undermines any trend analysis; if outsourced workers were previously included, the actual organic headcount decline (or growth) and turnover dynamics are obscured, making the presented trends unreliable. An investor would question the sustainability of operational excellence with such employee instability, demanding clarity on turnover reasons and retention strategies. The analysis also lacks employee distribution by specific functions (e.g., manufacturing, R&D, sales, administrative), which would provide insight into the effectiveness of the strategic pivot in terms of skill sets and resource allocation.

### b. Main Operating Assets, Their Strategic Importance, and Ownership

Fu Yu operates with a total production floor capacity exceeding 1.5 million square feet. The Singapore Smart Factory is central to its asset strategy, supporting high-precision, high-value manufacturing.

**Ownership of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)**

The Group's PPE comprises both owned and leased assets. Additions to PPE included Right-of-Use assets (leased) of S$2,449,000 in FY2024 (S$1,150,000 in FY2023).

| Metric (S$’000)      | FY2024   | FY2023    | FY2022   | Source                                    |
| :------------------- | :------- | :-------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Carrying Amount PPE  | 89,285   | 88,435    | 91,481   | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 113, "Note 3"]         |
| Carrying Amount ROU  | 5,618    | 5,091     | 4,286    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 113, "Note 3"]         |
| Additions to PPE     | 4,249    | 2,028     | 4,500    | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 113, "Note 3"]         |
| Additions to ROU     | 2,449    | 1,150     | 438      | [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 113, "Note 3"]         |

*Note: Interim data for PPE and Right-of-Use assets is not reported in the provided Q4 Financial Statements; only annual figures are consolidated.*

While the Singapore Smart Factory is strategically paramount for higher-margin product categories, its usable space of ~100,621 sqft represents only ~6.7% of the total production floor capacity (>1.5 million sqft). This raises questions about its current *actual* impact on overall group revenue and margins. Can such a small fraction of total capacity genuinely drive the entire company's shift to "high-end precision, high-value manufacturing" without significant upgrades or strategic shifts in the remaining 93.3% of the footprint? The analysis lacks quantification of the Smart Factory's expected revenue contribution, utilization rate, or specific new project wins that validate its strategic importance beyond its small physical footprint, or how it synergizes with the much larger, older facilities.

Furthermore, the significant increase in Additions to Right-of-Use (ROU) assets (leased) from S$438,000 in FY2022 to S$2,449,000 in FY2024 signals a notable shift in the Group's asset strategy. This growing reliance on leased assets, while preserving capital, could also reflect changing business models, difficulty in securing traditional financing, or a move towards more specialized, flexible equipment. Understanding the rationale behind this shift is crucial for assessing long-term capital management and future financial flexibility, as increased leasing commitments impact fixed obligations.

### c. Geographic Footprint and Alignment with Business Strategy

The Group operates 6 manufacturing sites across Singapore (2), Malaysia (2), and China (3), alongside its Singapore headquarters.

**Geographic Footprint**

*   **Singapore**: Fu Yu Corporation Ltd. (Headquarters), Fu Yu Biomedical Pte Ltd (same address), Smart Factory (9 Tuas Drive 1). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 14, "OUR NETWORK"]
*   **Malaysia**: Fu Hao Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd (Penang), Classic Advantage Sdn Bhd (Johor). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 14, "OUR NETWORK"]
*   **China**: Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Dongguan), Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Suzhou), Fu Yu Moulding & Tooling (Zhuhai). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 14, "OUR NETWORK"]

This multi-country footprint aligns with the strategy to offer "geographical flexibility" in response to "geopolitical uncertainty" and "customers seeking to source production away from China." The operational shift has led to a greater contribution from Singapore and Malaysia to manufacturing activities, with Chinese facilities now focusing on "China-for-China and China-for-Asia" strategies.

However, while the narrative suggests a strategic pivot away from China, the analysis notes a "significant impairment loss on property, plant and equipment in a China subsidiary (S$579,000 in FY2024)." An impairment loss typically signals underutilization, obsolescence, or a decline in expected future cash flows from an asset. This directly contradicts an optimistic "China-for-China" strategy, implying that assets in China are either not being effectively utilized or the local market strategy isn't as robust as implied. It suggests a potential overcapacity or struggle in the Chinese operations that warrants deeper investigation into their financial health and utilization rates.

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

The most significant and concerning change is the abrupt cessation of the Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) segment in Q4 FY2024. While presented by management as a "reallocation of resources," this move is underscored by severe red flags, including an "ongoing investigation into FYSCS’s past affairs," "significant weaknesses in risk management," and "potential misuse of resources," culminating in an "arbitral ruling" against FYSCS. Crucially, FYSCS was described as a "significant contributor to the Group's revenue in FY2024" before its cessation. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that all newly acquired "key customer relationships" shifting from one customer in FY2023 to three in FY2024 came *entirely from the now-discontinued FYSCS segment*. This implies a massive and immediate unquantified hole in future revenue and customer base, not merely a strategic pivot. It signals profound governance risks and raises questions about the integrity of past operational contributions and the actual stability of these customer relationships post-cessation. Investors require full transparency on the specific financial impact (past and future), remaining liabilities from the investigation and arbitration, and a clear strategy for replacing the lost revenue and customer relationships.

**Key Changes and Trends**

*   **Cessation of FYSCS**: All business activities ceased in Q4 FY2024. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 8, "FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS"; Page 15, "DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS"]
*   **Strategic Shift to High-Precision Manufacturing**: Continued investment in the Singapore Smart Factory, moving up the value chain to produce higher precision products (5-micron level). [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"]
*   **Renewable Energy Integration**: Installation of solar panels completed in Singapore facilities in FY2024, with Malaysia (Fu Hao and Classic Advantage) installations operational in Q4 FY2024 and Q2 FY2025. Total renewable energy generation capacity of up to 3,233 MWh. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 5, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
*   **Automation Drive**: Increased automation in the toolroom (aiming to reduce downtime by 40%), transition from hydraulic to electric machinery, integration of 3D printing. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
*   **Digital Transformation**: Implementation of a paperless mould-making process via an integrated cloud-based IT platform. [Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6, "CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"; Page 47, "Our Initiatives"]
*   **Workforce Optimization**: Decrease in overall headcount, with a regional shift of employees towards Singapore and away from China.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

The operating structure directly supports Fu Yu's competitive positioning as a "one-stop solution" provider and trusted partner for innovative, high-performance products.

*   **Advanced Capabilities**: The Singapore Smart Factory, with high-precision tooling, 3D printing, and cleanroom, positions Fu Yu for higher-value contracts in demanding sectors like medical devices. This directly supports the "advanced tooling with high precision" strategy.
*   **Geographic Diversification**: A multi-country operating footprint provides "geographical flexibility," catering to customers seeking to de-risk supply chains from geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding China.
*   **Value-Added Services**: Providing services from product design to assembly and testing, along with the New Product Introduction (NPI) team, enhances customer stickiness and allows participation in early business cycle stages.
*   **Sustainability Integration**: Investments in solar power and efforts in waste reduction (e.g., reusable containers, resin recycling) and eco-friendly materials enhance brand reputation and align with growing customer preferences for sustainable practices. The claim of a "greener, more responsible footprint" is supported by tangible actions like solar panel installations.
*   **Operational Efficiency**: Automation efforts, MES implementation in Malaysia, and digitalization aim to improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance quality, supporting "operational excellence."

However, the underlying health and sustainability of this competitive positioning are challenged by several factors. The significant impairment loss on property, plant and equipment in a China subsidiary (S$579,000 in FY2024) indicates underutilization or underperformance of assets in that region, directly contradicting the narrative of strategic geographic diversification and efficient asset deployment. More critically, the revelation that the shift to "three key customers in FY2024" relied *entirely on the now-discontinued FYSCS segment*, which was plagued by "significant weaknesses" and an ongoing investigation, casts a substantial shadow. This exposes the Group's past reliance on a problematic business unit for customer growth, undermining the perceived stability of its customer base and the robustness of its "one-stop solution" offering. This raises serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of client relationships and revenue generation, demanding clarification on whether these clients have successfully transitioned to the core manufacturing operations or are effectively lost.
