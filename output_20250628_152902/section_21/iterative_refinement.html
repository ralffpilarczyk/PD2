    <h2>Section 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning</h2>

    <p>Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Company" or "Fu Yu") possesses distinct competitive advantages that materially impact its economic performance over the next 12 months, positioning it favorably within the high-precision manufacturing industry. These advantages stem from its advanced technological capabilities, strategic geographical footprint, and deeply integrated customer solutions.</p>

    <h3>1. Advanced High-Precision Manufacturing Capabilities</h3>
    <p>Fu Yu’s flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, combined with its specialized cleanroom facilities and advanced tooling expertise, provides a significant technological and quality advantage over competitors. This enables the Company to produce highly complex, high-precision components critical for demanding sectors, thereby attracting customers in higher-value market segments.</p>

    <h4>Quantitative Measures & Financial Impact:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Superior Precision:</strong> The Company is capable of stabilizing high-precision products at the 5-micron level and is actively pursuing even higher levels of precision production. This capability differentiates Fu Yu from mass-market manufacturers. It allows the company to serve niche segments with stringent quality requirements, translating into better pricing power and margin potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Growth in High-Value Segments:</strong> Fu Yu's strategic focus on high-precision manufacturing led to securing new projects in the medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances sectors in FY2024. This attracted a "refreshed customer base" that includes "global leaders" in wound care, personal hygiene, and autonomous drone systems. These project wins were explicitly "achieved through advanced tooling with high precision and the introduction of our New Product Introduction ("NPI") team" [1].</li>
        <li><strong>Regional Performance & Profitability Turnaround:</strong> The investments in advanced capabilities have directly contributed to strong financial performance in key regions. Singapore's manufacturing operations, home to the Smart Factory, recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of S$1.2 million in FY2024, sharply reversing a Loss Before Tax (LBT) of S$6.9 million in FY2023 [2]. This turnaround was supported by a 20.9% increase in Singapore's manufacturing revenue to S$46.2 million in FY2024 from S$38.2 million in FY2023. This growth was driven by higher sales in the medical and consumer segments [3].</li>
        <li><strong>Margin Expansion:</strong> The Group’s gross profit margin for the continuing manufacturing segment improved to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023 [4]. This expansion is indicative of the successful shift towards higher-margin product categories enabled by the advanced tooling and NPI team [1].</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Translation to Financial Prospects:</h4>
    <p>This competitive advantage positions Fu Yu to capture a greater share of the high-growth, high-margin precision engineering market. The validated turnaround in Singapore operations and the overall manufacturing gross profit margin expansion demonstrate the immediate financial benefits of these capabilities. As new high-precision projects move into mass production, this advantage is expected to drive continued revenue growth and margin improvement, contributing positively to overall profitability over the next 12 months.</p>

    <h3>2. Strategic Geographical Diversification and Flexibility</h3>
    <p>Fu Yu’s strategically diversified manufacturing footprint across Singapore, Malaysia, and China offers significant flexibility and resilience in an increasingly volatile global environment. As a Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company with production in three countries, Fu Yu can offer geographical flexibility to customers seeking to de-risk their supply chains away from single-country concentrations. This is particularly relevant in light of ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties.</p>

    <h4>Quantitative Measures & Financial Impact:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resilient Revenue Growth Amid Geopolitical Shifts:</strong> In FY2024, despite a challenging economic recovery in China that led to an 11.8% decline in its manufacturing revenue to S$32.1 million (from S$36.4 million in FY2023) [5], Fu Yu successfully leveraged its other production sites. Singapore's manufacturing revenue increased by 20.9% to S$46.2 million, and Malaysia's operations grew by 24.9% to S$36.6 million in FY2024 [5].</li>
        <li><strong>Shifting Revenue Contribution:</strong> The revenue contribution from Singapore's manufacturing operations to the total manufacturing segment increased to 40.2% in FY2024 (from 36.8% in FY2023), and Malaysia's contribution rose to 31.9% (from 28.2% in FY2023). This successfully offset the reduction in China's share to 27.9% (from 35.0%) [5].</li>
        <li><strong>Overall Manufacturing Growth:</strong> This strategic flexibility ensured that the Group's total revenue from continuing manufacturing operations still grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million in FY2024 from S$103.9 million in FY2023 [4].</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Translation to Financial Prospects:</h4>
    <p>This multi-country presence provides a critical competitive edge by mitigating risks associated with regional disruptions. It also allows for agile allocation of production volumes to meet customer needs. This flexibility attracts new customers prioritizing supply chain resilience and fosters stronger relationships with existing clients. It translates into more stable and predictable revenue streams and better risk-adjusted financial performance over the next 12 months, as demonstrated by the continued growth in manufacturing revenue despite a significant reduction in one key market.</p>

    <h3>3. Vertically Integrated One-Stop Solution and Deep Customer Relationships</h3>
    <p>Fu Yu offers a comprehensive, vertically integrated "one-stop solution"—from product design and tooling fabrication to production and assembly. This significantly enhances customer value and fosters long-term, "sticky" relationships. This is further strengthened by its NPI team, which engages customers in the early stages of product development.</p>

    <h4>Quantitative Measures & Financial Impact:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer-Driven Order Book Growth:</strong> The Group’s order book at the end of FY2024 increased by a substantial 20% year-on-year [1]. This growth is attributed to "higher order volumes and interest in increasing order volumes from existing customers," as well as "new projects secured" [1]. This directly reflects the strength of its customer relationships and the value proposition of its integrated services.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Revenue Visibility:</strong> Projects involving high-precision tooling, a key focus of Fu Yu's current strategy, are noted for their "relatively 'sticky' nature." They are also expected to "translate into long-term sustainable revenue" [1]. The commencement of mass production for several high-precision projects that were previously in gestation provides strong revenue visibility for FY2025 [1].</li>
        <li><strong>Margin Improvement from Value-Add:</strong> The continuous gross profit margin improvement in the manufacturing segment, from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024 [4], is a direct result of being able to offer value-added services and secure projects in "higher-margin product categories" [1]. This suggests enhanced pricing power and a focus on more profitable engagements stemming from its comprehensive offering and NPI capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Overall Profitability:</strong> The strategic focus on core manufacturing and high-value customer relationships contributed to the Company sharply narrowing its net loss from continuing operations to S$1.2 million in FY2024 from S$7.6 million in FY2023 [6]. This significant improvement highlights the positive financial impact of strengthening customer ties and moving up the value chain through integrated solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Translation to Financial Prospects:</h4>
    <p>The integrated service model makes Fu Yu an indispensable partner for its customers, leading to high customer retention rates and a stable foundation for future revenue. The substantial increase in the order book provides clear forward revenue visibility, while the improved margins demonstrate the Company's ability to drive profitability through value-added services. This competitive advantage is crucial for driving sustained financial performance and market leadership in its niche segments over the next 12 months.</p>
