**One-Time Items and Adjustments:**
*   **FY2024:** Goodwill impairment of S$3.286m (SCS segment); PPE impairment of S$0.579m (China subsidiary). Discontinuation of SCS segment in Q4 2024. (FS p.4, 5, 10, 12, 15; AR p.115, 119)
*   **FY2023:** Goodwill impairment of S$2.678m; loss on liquidation of subsidiary of S$0.432m; reversal of impairment loss on investments in subsidiaries of S$3.825m. (FS p.10, 12, 15; AR p.109, 115, 119)

#### Key Recent Trends

*   **Revenue Volatility & Strategic Shift:** Consolidated revenue was flat in FY2024 (+0.5%) after a 20.7% FY2023 decline. This reflects a strategic refocus: core Manufacturing revenue grew 10.5% (Singapore +20.9%, Malaysia +24.9%), while China declined 11.8% and the now-discontinued SCS segment revenue fell 11.6%. (AR p.5, 8, 9; FS p.4, 20, 32)
*   **Profitability Turnaround (Continuing Operations):** Net loss from continuing operations significantly narrowed from S$7.6m (FY2023) to S$1.2m (FY2024). Consolidated EBITDA and Operating Income also showed positive trends, improving from substantial losses in FY2023 to positive EBITDA and reduced operating losses in FY2024, indicating core business improvements. (AR p.5, 8, 109; FS p.4)
*   **Interim Period Dynamics:** 1H2024 saw a 78.0% revenue increase and positive net income (S$0.1m), largely due to SCS segment performance. Conversely, 2H2024 revenue sharply declined 45.8% post-SCS discontinuation, leading to a larger net loss and illustrating the segment's distorting effect. (Pres H124 p.5, 6; FS p.4, 15, 32)

#### Margin Analysis

| Metric                         | FY2024   | FY2023   | FY2022   |
| :----------------------------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| Consolidated Net Income Margin | -2.04%   | -5.31%   | 6.08%    |
| Consolidated EBITDA Margin     | 4.91%    | 0.35%    | 10.41%   |
| Consolidated Operating Income Margin | -1.21%   | -5.08%   | 8.33%    |
| Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin | 13.5%    | 11.7%    | N/A      |
| Consolidated Gross Profit Margin | 8.9%     | 7.0%     | N/A      |
| Capex % of Revenue             | 3.63%    | 2.08%    | 1.46%    |

*   **Overall Margin Improvement:** The Group's consolidated gross profit margin improved from 7.0% (FY2023) to 8.9% (FY2024), driven by the manufacturing segment's rise from 11.7% to 13.5%. Management attributes this to strategic transformation, advanced tooling, and new product introduction (NPI) initiatives. (AR p.5, 8)
*   **EBITDA Turnaround:** Consolidated EBITDA margin significantly improved from a marginal 0.35% (FY2023) to a robust 4.91% (FY2024). This positive shift reflects enhanced operational efficiency and effective cost-containment, including a 20.4% reduction in selling and administrative expenses. (AR p.8; FS p.4)
*   **Persistent Losses:** Despite gross profit and EBITDA margin improvements, the Group reported a consolidated net loss for FY2024. The negative consolidated operating income margin indicates overall operations, even before finance costs and taxes, remained unprofitable, weighed by discontinued segment losses and non-recurring charges. (FS p.4)

#### Cash Flow Assessment

*   **Positive Operating Cash Flow:** A key achievement for FY2024 was the return to positive net operating cash inflow of S$3.6m, a significant reversal from the S$4.5m outflow in FY2023. This stemmed from a lower pre-tax loss and effective working capital management. (AR p.5, 9, 119)
*   **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Capex notably increased to S$6.9m (FY2024) from S$4.0m (FY2023), reflecting a rise in Capex as a percentage of revenue from 2.08% to 3.63%. This investment supports strategic enhancement of manufacturing capabilities, particularly the Singapore Smart Factory. (AR p.9, 119; FS p.10)
*   **Cash Conversion:** Per the specified formula (EBITDA / (EBITDA/Capex)), cash conversion simplifies to Capex: S$6,940k in FY2024 and S$3,962k in FY2023.
*   **Liquidity Position:** The Group maintained a sound net cash position of S$55.5m as at 31 December 2024, a slight decrease from S$60.3m (FY2023). This reduction reflects strategic deployment of cash towards operational improvements and growth. (AR p.5, 9; FS p.3)

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

*No explicit financial forecasts or industry benchmarks were provided in the analyzed documents.*

**Two Key Achievements:**

1.  **Successful Strategic Transformation of Core Manufacturing:** Fu Yu effectively advanced its strategic transformation, improving the core manufacturing segment's performance. Manufacturing gross profit significantly increased by 28.1%, with its margin improving from 11.7% (FY2023) to 13.5% (FY2024), driven by new project wins and investment in advanced tooling. (AR p.5, 8)
2.  **Robust Turnaround in Operating Cash Flow:** The Group reversed a substantial negative operating cash flow, converting an S$4.5m outflow (FY2023) into an S$3.6m net inflow (FY2024). This milestone indicates enhanced working capital management and operational efficiency, providing crucial internal funding for investments. (AR p.5, 9)

**Two Key Challenges:**

1.  **Persistent Consolidated Losses and Discontinued Operations Impact:** Despite manufacturing gains, the Group recorded an overall consolidated net loss of S$3.9m for FY2024. The full financial impact of discontinuing the loss-contributing SCS segment and related goodwill impairment (S$3.286m in FY2024) will burden future periods, highlighting past strategic missteps. (AR p.8, 109, 115; FS p.4, 15)
2.  **Navigating Geopolitical and Economic Headwinds:** Management acknowledges a "challenging operating landscape" and "geopolitical uncertainty" affecting supply chains and costs. The 11.8% decline in China manufacturing revenue directly reflects these external factors, necessitating ongoing geographical rebalancing as "more customers seek to source production away from China." (AR p.6, 9; FS p.32)

**Two Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**

1.  **Optimistic Framing vs. Consolidated Financial Reality:** The Chairman's message asserts "sharp improvement" and a "growth trajectory." While *continuing manufacturing operations* did recover (net loss narrowed from S$7.6m to S$1.2m), *consolidated* revenue growth was minimal (+0.5% FY2024 vs. FY2023), and the Group remained in a consolidated net loss of S$3.9m. This narrative selectively emphasizes positive segment trends, downplaying overall top-line stagnation and bottom-line losses influenced by the SCS segment. (AR p.5, 8; FS p.4)
2.  **Understated Systemic Risk of Internal Control Weaknesses:** The Directors' Statement reveals a "qualified opinion" from auditors due to "ongoing investigation into the affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd" and "significant weaknesses" in its risk management (AR p.100, 104). Management's claim that issues are "isolated" (AR p.6) understates the systemic risk from such fundamental internal control failures, compromising consolidated financial reliability, potential legal liabilities, and investor confidence.
