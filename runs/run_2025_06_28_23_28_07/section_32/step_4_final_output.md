### Executive Summary: Critical Insights & Key Concerns

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's FY2024 performance reveals a company grappling with significant internal control deficiencies and the severe repercussions of a problematic Supply Chain Management (SCM) segment. While the manufacturing operations show some signs of recovery, the overall financial health is overshadowed by substantial losses, asset impairments, and a looming external investigation.

**Key Concerns & Red Flags:**

1.  **SCM Segment Collapse & Governance Failures:** The most pressing issue is the catastrophic decline and ultimate cessation of the SCM segment (Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd. - FYSCS). This segment's revenue plummeted by 93% in 2H24 compared to 2H23 (AR Pg. 141), driving substantial losses and necessitating a full impairment of S$3.29 million in goodwill (AR Pg. 120). The ongoing investigation (AR Pg. 155) explicitly points to "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," "irregular expense claims," and critically, the Board's admission of "inadequate internal controls" within this segment. This indicates **profound governance failures and a high risk of financial irregularities and reputational damage.** The recent arbitration loss of S$1.67 million (AR Pg. 156) directly stemming from FYSCS further underscores the liabilities arising from this segment.

2.  **Financial Instability Despite Manufacturing Gains:** While revenue from *continuing operations* (manufacturing) increased by 10.5% (AR Pg. 8), the Group still reported a net loss of S$3.9 million for FY2024 (AR Pg. 8). The reduction in net loss from S$(10.1) million in FY2023 is primarily attributable to containing the escalating losses from the now-discontinued SCM segment, rather than a robust return to profitability in core operations. Significant impairments on intercompany receivables (S$3.94 million recognized in FY2024, bringing total allowance to S$11.87 million) (AR Pg. 122) also signal underlying financial vulnerabilities tied to subsidiary performance, likely exacerbated by the SCM issues. The company appears to be in a crucial cleanup phase, with the path to sustained profitability remaining uncertain.

3.  **Questionable Sustainability Reporting Credibility:** Discrepancies and omissions within the sustainability data raise concerns about the accuracy and transparency of ESG disclosures. Notably, the Board Composition by Age (AR Pg. 55) contains a factual error, stating "100% 30-50 yrs old" when public records indicate several directors are over 50. Furthermore, the problematic FYSCS entity is explicitly excluded from 'Protecting the Environment' reporting (AR Pg. 65), which, given the severe operational and financial issues, suggests a selective approach to disclosure. Claims of "zero confirmed incidents of corruption" (AR Pg. 63) are difficult to reconcile with the active FYSCS investigation flagging "unverifiable arrangements" and "irregular expense claims."

4.  **Talent Exodus & Leadership Stability:** The timing of the departures of a key management personnel (Seow E-lin, Elaine, GCEO's family member) (AR Pg. 87) and the substantial shareholder Lim Wei De, Victor (AR Pg. 87, 172), shortly after FY2024 and concurrent with the FYSCS investigation, raises questions about potential internal fallout and leadership stability. While reasons are not disclosed, the optics are concerning amidst the ongoing probe.

5.  **Operational Efficiencies & Workforce Development:** A consistent decline in average training hours per employee (AR Pg. 57) falling short of future targets (13.2 hrs in FY2024 vs. 15 hrs target for FY2025), coupled with historically high employee turnover rates (over 50% in FY2022/2023) (AR Pg. 50) points to potential weaknesses in human capital development and retention strategies.

**In summary, Fu Yu presents a high-risk investment profile. The company's immediate future is heavily dependent on the transparent and effective resolution of the FYSCS investigation and its financial ramifications, alongside a proven ability to stabilize and grow its core manufacturing business.**

### Detailed Analysis: Explaining the Drivers

#### 1. The Catastrophic SCM Collapse & Deep-Seated Governance Failures

The core of Fu Yu's current distress stems from its now-discontinued Supply Chain Management (SCM) segment, Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd. (FYSCS). The segment's external revenue plummeted from S$67.87 million in 2H23 to just S$4.43 million in 2H24, a **93% collapse in a single half-year** (AR Pg. 141). This precipitous decline forced a full impairment of S$3.29 million in goodwill attributable to FYSCS (AR Pg. 120), recognized within discontinued operations.

An ongoing independent investigation (AR Pg. 155) into FYSCS has uncovered severe red flags, including:
*   "Unverifiable arrangements" for a US$2.98 million payment for unrendered services, suggesting potential conflicts of interest.
*   "Unauthorized usage of an email account."
*   "Irregular expense claims" by former employees.
*   A critical admission by the Board of "inadequate internal controls" within the segment.

These findings strongly imply financial irregularities and a systemic failure of oversight, directly resulting in substantial financial liabilities. A recent arbitration ruling against FYSCS, resulting in an S$1.67 million payment, further confirms the financial fallout (AR Pg. 156). Compounding this, the Company's intercompany receivables from subsidiaries show increasing impairment losses, with S$3.94 million recognized in FY2024, bringing the total allowance to S$11.87 million (AR Pg. 122), likely exacerbated by the FYSCS issues.

The integrity of the company's reporting is also undermined. Despite the FYSCS investigation, the company reported "zero confirmed incidents of corruption" for FY2024 (AR Pg. 63). Furthermore, FYSCS is conspicuously excluded from 'Protecting the Environment' sustainability reporting (AR Pg. 65), and the Board's stated age composition (100% 30-50 years old) is demonstrably false based on public records (AR Pg. 55). These discrepancies raise serious questions about the completeness and reliability of Fu Yu's broader ESG disclosures.

#### 2. Financial Health: Stabilisation Amidst Continuing Challenges

The Group's net loss improved to S$(3.9) million in FY2024 from S$(10.1) million in FY2023 (AR Pg. 8). This improvement is largely due to containing losses from the SCM segment, rather than strong organic profitability from core operations. While manufacturing revenue did grow by 10.5% (AR Pg. 8), the segment still experienced losses before tax in Singapore (S$(2.83) million in FY2024 from S$1.93 million profit in FY2023) and China (S$(4.90) million in FY2024 from S$(3.29) million in FY2023) (AR Pg. 143), offsetting positive performance in Malaysia. A S$0.58 million impairment on property, plant and equipment was also recognized in FY2024, indicating specific asset utilization challenges in a China subsidiary (AR Pg. 116).

On a positive note, Fu Yu fully repaid all its bank loans in FY2024, eliminating this external debt and significantly reducing finance costs (AR Pg. 125). However, the Group's cash and bank balances decreased by S$4.79 million to S$55.53 million (AR Pg. 128), and unrecognized unutilised tax losses more than doubled to S$10.85 million (AR Pg. 123), indicating continued underlying unprofitability and a lack of confidence in generating sufficient future taxable profits. Capital expenditure for manufacturing more than doubled to S$6.94 million (AR Pg. 144), signaling a strategic pivot and investment in core capabilities. The GCEO also increased his direct shareholding from 4 million to 9 million shares through the vesting of his Restricted Share Plan awards, aligning his incentives with shareholder interests (AR Pg. 101, 128).

#### 3. Human Capital & Leadership Stability Concerns

The integrity issues at FYSCS appear to have coincided with notable personnel changes. Both a key management personnel, Seow E-lin, Elaine (GCEO's family member), and substantial shareholder Lim Wei De, Victor, departed the company shortly after the FY2024 year-end and the interim report on the FYSCS investigation was announced (AR Pg. 87, 172). The timing of these high-profile exits raises questions about potential internal fallout.

Furthermore, the Board of Directors exhibits a complete lack of gender diversity (100% male) (AR Pg. 55), and female representation significantly decreases at higher management levels, from 53.7% at the worker level to only 20.0% at senior management (AR Pg. 55). Combined with a consistent decline in average training hours per employee (AR Pg. 57) and historically high employee turnover rates in prior years (over 50% in FY2022 and FY2023) (AR Pg. 50), this points to potential weaknesses in human capital development and retention, which could hinder long-term recovery efforts.
