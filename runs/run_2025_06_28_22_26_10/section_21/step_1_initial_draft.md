## SECTION 21: Sellside Positioning - Competitive Positioning - Fu Yu Corporation Limited

Fu Yu Corporation Limited ("Fu Yu" or "the Company") is positioning its core manufacturing business as the primary driver of future economic performance, especially following the strategic decision to cease its loss-making supply chain management services segment. The analysis below identifies the three most important competitive advantages that materially impact the Company's economic performance over the next 12 months, focusing on specific, measurable advantages relative to the competitive landscape.

### 1. Advanced Precision Manufacturing & Smart Factory Capabilities

Fu Yu's flagship Smart Factory in Singapore, alongside ongoing investments across its manufacturing network, represents a significant competitive advantage in precision engineering. This technological edge enables the Company to target higher-value, more complex projects.

*   **Qualitative Advantage:** The Smart Factory in Singapore is described as "one of Asia's most advanced precision manufacturing facilities," capable of "manufacturing complex mould inserts, high precision tooling, and 3D metal printing for rapid prototyping." It also features a "100K-class cleanroom for manufacturing and assembling biomedical products" and is equipped with "Industry 4.0 machinery" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). The Company is actively "stabilising high-precision products at the 5-micron precision level and moving up the value chain to produce even higher levels of precision" (FY2024 AR, p. 6). Furthermore, the completion of an "Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrated cloud-based IT platform" allows for "paperless mould-making" (FY2024 AR, p. 6, 47), streamlining operations and enhancing accuracy.
*   **Quantitative Impact & Financial Prospects:** These advanced capabilities directly translate to improved profitability and project wins in specialized segments. The manufacturing segment's Gross Profit Margin (GPM) improved to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023, an increase of 1.8 percentage points (FY2024 AR, p. 8). This is significantly higher than the discontinued supply chain management segment's GPM of 1.9% in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 8), indicating a shift towards higher-value activities in the core business. New project wins in "medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances" (FY2024 AR, p. 5) are a direct result of "advanced tooling with high precision" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). The Company expects these "high-precision projects" to "translate into long-term sustainable revenue" given their "relatively 'sticky' nature" (FY2024 AR, p. 6). The Group also anticipates a reduction in downtime by "40% compared to a typical facility" through increased automation (FY2024 AR, p. 6), directly impacting operational efficiency and cost control over the next 12 months. Capital expenditure for FY2024 was S$6.9 million, primarily for "factory equipment, plant and machineries" (FY2024 AR, p. 9; FY2024 Q4 FS, p. 3), reinforcing this technological investment.

### 2. Vertically-Integrated Services & Customer-Centric Approach

Fu Yu's "one-stop solution" model, combined with dedicated customer engagement, fosters strong, long-term relationships and drives new customer acquisition, especially in high-growth sectors.

*   **Qualitative Advantage:** Fu Yu offers "vertically-integrated manufacturing services" including "product design, tooling design and fabrication, production, assembly and testing" (FY2024 AR, p. 2), providing a "one-stop solution" for customers. The "New Product Introduction ("NPI") team" adds value "in the early stages of the business cycle, giving new customers – particularly those in higher-margin product categories – the confidence that we can scale up production while maintaining quality" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). This approach helps build "mutually beneficial long-term partnerships" (FY2024 AR, p. 2) and has attracted a "refreshed customer base now includes global leaders in wound care and personal hygiene, autonomous drone systems, and next-generation coffee machines" (FY2024 AR, p. 5).
*   **Quantitative Impact & Financial Prospects:** The focus on comprehensive services and customer relationships directly contributed to the 10.5% revenue growth in manufacturing operations to S$114.9 million in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 5). This growth was fueled by "higher order volumes from existing customers, as well as new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (FY2024 AR, p. 5). The Company's order book increased "20% year-on-year" at the end of FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 6), indicating strong forward demand from both existing and new clients. The ability to win "new projects across a broad spectrum of industries" (FY2024 AR, p. 5) demonstrates the market's positive response to their integrated offerings and reliability.

### 3. Geographical Diversification & Supply Chain Agility

Fu Yu's manufacturing presence across Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides critical flexibility and resilience, particularly amid increasing geopolitical uncertainties and a global shift away from China-centric supply chains.

*   **Qualitative Advantage:** As a "Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed company with production in three countries," Fu Yu can "offer geographical flexibility in a business environment fraught with geopolitical uncertainty" (FY2024 AR, p. 6). Management explicitly notes that "more customers seek to source production away from China" (FY2024 AR, p. 6), positioning Fu Yu to capitalize on this trend. The Company also highlights its strategy to "diversify our suppliers globally" to enhance supply chain resilience (FY2024 AR, p. 33).
*   **Quantitative Impact & Financial Prospects:** This strategic advantage is reflected in the shifting revenue contributions by location for the manufacturing segment in FY2024. While China's contribution to total manufacturing revenue decreased by 7.1 percentage points to 27.9% (from 35.0% in FY2023), Singapore's share increased by 3.4 percentage points to 40.2% (from 36.8%), and Malaysia's increased by 3.7 percentage points to 31.9% (from 28.2%) (FY2024 AR, p. 5, 9). Critically, Singapore's manufacturing sales "improved 20.9% to S$46.2 million" and Malaysia's revenue "improved 24.9% to S$36.6 million" in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 9), effectively offsetting an 11.8% decline in China's revenue (FY2024 AR, p. 9). This demonstrates successful execution of geographical rebalancing and its direct positive impact on revenue growth in key regions, indicating a superior ability to adapt to macro-environmental shifts compared to less diversified competitors.

**Critical Analysis:**
While the Company's strategic shifts in its manufacturing segment demonstrate clear competitive advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant drag from the now-discontinued Supply Chain Management Services segment. The internal audit findings of "significant weaknesses" and the "ongoing investigation" into FYSCS (FY2024 AR, p. 6, 115; FY2024 Q4 FS, p. 26-27), leading to a qualified audit opinion for FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 104), cast a shadow over overall corporate governance and risk management, which could impact investor confidence and access to capital despite positive developments in the core business. Management's claim of "clearly on a growth trajectory" (FY2024 AR, p. 6) must be viewed specifically for the manufacturing segment, as the overall Group's net loss narrowed but remained at S$3.9 million in FY2024 (FY2024 AR, p. 8), partially due to the impairment of goodwill related to FYSCS. The translation of new project wins into "long-term sustainable revenue" remains a prospect for the next 12 months, supported by the 20% increase in order book (FY2024 AR, p. 6). The absence of direct competitor comparisons makes it challenging to quantitatively assess "superiority" beyond internal improvements and strategic shifts.
