### Key Recent Trends

**Revenue Growth:**
*   **Annual:** Group total revenue remained relatively stable from FY2023 to FY2024 (S$190.4M to S$191.3M) but was significantly lower than FY2022 (S$240.1M) due to the discontinued supply chain segment. Focusing on continuing operations (manufacturing), revenue showed a strong 10.5% growth from S$103.9 million in FY2023 to S$114.9 million in FY2024. This was primarily driven by higher sales in Singapore (+20.9% to S$46.2M) and Malaysia (+24.9% to S$36.6M), partially offset by a decline in China (-11.8% to S$32.1M). [AR p.7, p.8, p.90]
*   **Interim:** 2H2024 manufacturing revenue was S$60.1 million, a 17.2% increase compared to 2H2023 (S$51.3 million), indicating an accelerating recovery in the second half of FY2024. [FS Q424 p.4]

**Margin Evolution:**
*   **Gross Profit Margin (GPM):** The Group's GPM for continuing operations improved significantly from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024. This positive trend is also evident in the interim periods, with 2H2024 GPM at 13.2% compared to 11.6% in 2H2023. [AR p.7, FS Q424 p.4] This reflects higher order volumes and new projects in higher-margin segments like medical and consumer. [AR p.7]
*   **EBITDA and Operating Margins:** Continuing operations' EBITDA margin turned strongly positive, from 0.6% in FY2023 to 7.4% in FY2024 (S$0.6M to S$8.5M). Operating Income (EBIT) also improved from a loss of S$(7.3)M (-7.0%) in FY2023 to a profit of S$0.4M (0.3%) in FY2024. This dramatic improvement is attributed to higher revenue, better gross margins, and a substantial 20.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses (S$21.6M to S$17.2M). [AR p.7, p.8]
*   **Net Income Margin:** The net loss from continuing operations narrowed sharply from S$(7.6)M (-7.3%) in FY2023 to S$(1.2)M (-1.0%) in FY2024. This significant reduction in losses underscores the effectiveness of strategic shifts and cost control measures. [AR p.7]

**Cash Flow Generation:**
*   The Group demonstrated a notable turnaround in operating cash flow, moving from a net outflow of S$(4.5) million in FY2023 to a net inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024. This was primarily driven by the lower loss before tax, decreases in inventories, and trade and other receivables. [AR p.7, p.8]
*   Capital expenditure for manufacturing operations increased to S$6.9 million in FY2024 (6.0% of revenue) from S$3.7 million in FY2023 (3.6% of revenue), reflecting investments in factory equipment, plant, and machinery. [AR p.8, FS Q424 p.24]
*   Cash conversion (Operating Cash Flow / EBITDA) for continuing operations, while fluctuating, shows improvement. The Group's ability to generate positive operating cash flow in FY2024, despite a net loss, indicates better working capital management.

### Performance Assessment

**Achievement vs. Guidance:**
*   The Chairman's message noted that the "core manufacturing segment recorded, for the first time in more than a decade, a sharp improvement" in FY2024. [AR p.7] This is consistent with the significant narrowing of net loss and improved margins observed.
*   Management highlighted a 20% year-on-year increase in the order book at the end of FY2024, expected to positively contribute to FY2025 financial performance. [AR p.7, FS Q424 p.29] This reflects positive momentum and achievement of strategic transformation goals.
*   The strategic initiatives such as focusing on high-precision manufacturing, securing new projects in biomedical and consumer segments, and introducing the New Product Introduction (NPI) team, appear to be bearing fruit. [AR p.7, Fuyu Pres H124 p.11]

**Industry Comparison:**
*   No explicit industry benchmarks are provided in the documents. However, the Group acknowledges a "challenging operating environment" marked by "geopolitical uncertainty" and customers seeking to source production away from China. [AR p.7] The Group positions itself to benefit from this trend due to its multi-country production footprint.
*   Headwinds mentioned include "longer shipping lead times, higher costs of raw materials and further disruptions to the supply chain, arising from geopolitical tensions" and "US election run-up could further escalate US-China trade tensions". [FS Q424 p.29] This indicates a cautious but proactive stance in a volatile market.

**Key Drivers of Performance:**
*   **Positive Drivers:**
    *   **Strategic Transformation:** The shift to focus on high-precision manufacturing, biomedical, and consumer segments has yielded higher-margin projects.
    *   **Customer Wins:** Higher order volumes from existing customers and new project wins (e.g., microfluidic chips, drug delivery devices) contributed to revenue growth. [AR p.7, Fuyu Pres H124 p.11]
    *   **Cost Management:** Significant reduction in selling and administrative expenses. [AR p.8]
    *   **Geographical Shift:** Growth in Singapore and Malaysia operations offset the decline in China. [AR p.7]
    *   **Operational Efficiency:** Investment in the Smart Factory (Singapore) and energy-efficient machinery. [AR p.7, AR p.38]
*   **Challenges/Risks:**
    *   **China Operations:** Slower-than-expected economic recovery in China led to declining revenue from the Group's China operations. [AR p.8]
    *   **Discontinued Operations (FYSCS):** The cessation of the supply chain management services segment incurred a S$3.3 million goodwill impairment and a net loss of S$2.7 million in FY2024. [AR p.7, FS Q424 p.26]

### MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**Two Key Achievements:**
1.  **Manufacturing Turnaround and Margin Improvement:** Fu Yu's continuing manufacturing operations achieved a significant financial turnaround in FY2024. Revenue grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million, and notably, EBITDA increased over 14-fold to S$8.5 million (from S$0.6 million in FY2023), improving the EBITDA margin from 0.6% to 7.4%. Net loss sharply narrowed from S$7.6 million to S$1.2 million. This was driven by higher order volumes, new projects in biomedical and consumer segments, and successful strategic transformation efforts. [AR p.7, "FY2024 Financial Performance"]
2.  **Positive Operating Cash Flow:** The Group successfully reversed its operating cash flow from an outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 to an inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024. This demonstrates improved working capital management and financial stability, allowing the Group to fund its operations from internal cash generation. [AR p.7, "FINANCIAL POSITION", "The Group generated net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024"]

**Two Key Challenges:**
1.  **China Market Weakness:** The Group's operations in China experienced a revenue decline of 11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024 and continued to be loss-making (LBT of S$4.3 million), due to "slower business activities amid a slower-than-expected recovery in China's economy". This geographic segment remains a drag on overall manufacturing profitability. [AR p.8, "BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW - China"]
2.  **FYSCS Investigation and Financial Uncertainty:** The discontinuation of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) was accompanied by a S$3.3 million goodwill impairment and a S$2.7 million net loss from discontinued operations in FY2024. More critically, an ongoing investigation initiated in late FY2024, stemming from an internal audit report (dated 26 July 2024) highlighting "significant weaknesses" and "considerable concern" in FYSCS's risk management process, has led to potential claims against individuals for "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," and "irregular" expense claims. The external auditors issued a *qualified opinion* due to their inability to determine the potential financial impact of this ongoing investigation. [AR p.7, "FORWARD STRATEGIES - FU YU SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS"; AR p.61, "Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls"; AR p.104, "Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements - Qualified Opinion - Ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd"]

**Two Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance:**
1.  **Stated Reason for FYSCS Discontinuation vs. Underlying Issues:** Management initially stated the discontinuation of FYSCS was due to "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business." [FS Q424 p.26] However, the detailed disclosures in the Annual Report's "Risk Management Report" and "Notes to the Financial Statements" reveal that the cessation followed an internal audit uncovering "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management and a subsequent external investigation into alleged "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," and "irregular" expense claims. The auditor's *qualified opinion* on the financial statements further underscores severe underlying governance and control issues within FYSCS, indicating that the 'inability to find a candidate' was likely a symptom or a more palatable public narrative, rather than the primary root cause of the business segment's failure and subsequent liquidation. This points to systemic governance and internal control weaknesses. [FS Q424 p.26; AR p.7, p.61, p.104, Note 32]
2.  **Optimistic Outlook Amidst Significant Unresolved Risks:** Management projects optimism for FY2025, anticipating improved financial performance and a 20% year-on-year increase in order book, suggesting a clear growth trajectory. [FS Q424 p.29, "OUTLOOK - Group Outlook"] While manufacturing is improving, this optimistic outlook appears to downplay the significant, unresolved financial and reputational risks posed by the ongoing FYSCS investigation and the auditor's qualified opinion. The investigation's outcome, potential claims, and reputational damage could materially impact the Group's financial position and operational stability, even for the core manufacturing segment, which is currently presented as unaffected by the specific FYSCS issues. There is no explicit discussion of how the potential financial fallout from the FYSCS investigation is factored into the FY2025 optimism. [AR p.104, "Basis for Qualified Opinion"; FS Q424 p.29]
