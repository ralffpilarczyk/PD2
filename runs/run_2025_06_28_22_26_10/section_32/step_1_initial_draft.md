## SECTION 32: Analysis

### 1. Overall Financial Health and Strategic Shift

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (Fu Yu) presents a financial narrative of a company in transition. The group's overall revenue increased marginally by 0.5% to S$191.3 million in FY2024 (FY2023: S$190.4 million) (Table B.1.1). This modest growth masks a significant strategic pivot: the discontinuation of the Supply Chain Management Services (SCS) segment in Q4 2024. While the SCS segment contributed S$76.4 million to FY2024 revenue, down from S$86.4 million in FY2023, its cessation signals a focused return to the core manufacturing business (Table C.15.1, C.21.1). The ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs, highlighted by a qualified audit opinion and management's inability to fully assure internal controls for this segment, strongly supports this strategic decision (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 104, 99). The financial impact of the SCS segment's discontinuation is notable, with it contributing a loss of S$2.672 million (FY2024) and S$2.513 million (FY2023) to the overall net loss (Table B.1.1).

Despite the overall net loss of S$3.892 million in FY2024 (narrowed from S$10.113 million in FY2023) (Table B.1.1), the core manufacturing operations show signs of recovery. Manufacturing revenue grew by 10.5% to S$114.888 million (FY2023: S$103.941 million), and gross profit for this segment increased by 28.1% to S$15.5 million (FY2023: S$12.1 million), leading to an improved gross profit margin of 13.5% (FY2023: 11.7%) (Table B.1.1). This suggests the underlying core business is gaining traction, validating management's strategic focus.

### 2. Operational Performance & Efficiency

The operational data largely supports the narrative of efficiency improvements within the manufacturing segment. Selling and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by 20.5% in FY2024 (Table B.1.1), indicating effective cost-containment measures.

**Environmental Performance:** Energy consumption (excluding petrol and diesel) decreased by 2.5% in FY2024, with the introduction of solar energy contributing 4,001.8 GJ (Table A.4.1). Total GHG emissions saw a slight reduction of 1.1% in absolute terms and a decrease in intensity, from 214.4 tCO2e/S$ million revenue in FY2023 to 191.9 tCO2e/S$ million revenue in FY2024 (Table A.4.4). Water consumption also decreased by 9.1% (Table A.4.5), and hazardous waste reduced by 25.7% (Table A.4.6), demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability, likely driven by the adoption of solar panels and efforts to enhance production efficiency.

**Workforce Dynamics:** Total employee headcount slightly decreased from 1,488 in FY2023 to 1,372 in FY2024 (Table A.1.2). The overall turnover rate decreased to 24.9% in FY2024 from a high of 63.8% in FY2023, and new hire rate also fell to 26.7% from 60.7% in FY2023 (Table A.1.3, A.1.4). While average training hours per employee decreased in FY2024 (Table A.2.1, A.2.2), potentially due to "training budget control and shift in company priorities", the high rates of performance and career development reviews (91-100% across management levels) (Table A.2.3) suggest ongoing engagement in employee development. The increase in recordable work-related injuries, from 13 cases (3.5 rate) in FY2023 to 14 cases (4.6 rate) in FY2024 (Table A.3.1), is a red flag, requiring closer attention despite management's stated efforts in safety guidelines.

### 3. Financial Position and Liquidity

Fu Yu maintains a healthy financial position with net cash of S$55.5 million as at 31 December 2024 (Table B.2.1, C.11.1). Total assets slightly decreased to S$173.8 million (FY2023: S$176.2 million), mainly due to reduced cash balances and impairment of goodwill, offset by increased PPE and inventories (Table B.2.1). Total liabilities also decreased to S$37.1 million (FY2023: S$38.7 million), driven by lower loans and borrowings (Table B.2.1). The gearing ratio remains at "Net Cash" for both years (Table C.1.1), indicating a strong balance sheet.

Cash flow from operations turned positive in FY2024, generating S$3.597 million compared to an outflow of S$4.540 million in FY2023 (Table B.3.1), primarily due to improved loss before tax and working capital management. Investing activities reflect continued capital expenditure of S$6.940 million, mainly for factory equipment and machinery, signaling ongoing investment in manufacturing capabilities (Table B.3.1, C.23.1).

### 4. Governance and Shareholder Data

The company details a robust governance structure, including a Board with a majority of independent non-executive directors (Table E.1.1, E.1.2), and dedicated Audit, Nominating, and Remuneration Committees. All governance body members and employees have received 100% communication and training on anti-corruption policies (Table A.5.2, A.5.3). However, the ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs, which led to a qualified audit opinion, casts a shadow over the "sound system of risk management and internal controls" narrative, particularly concerning the discontinued segment (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 104). The internal audit report highlighting "significant weaknesses" in FYSCS's risk management process and potential "unverifiable arrangements" and "unauthorized usage" raises serious corporate governance concerns that the company is actively addressing with external professionals.

Shareholder data shows Lim Wei De Victor as the substantial shareholder with 29.45% direct interest (Table E.3.3), and the top 20 shareholders account for 60.03% of shares (Table E.3.4). The company confirmed compliance with Rule 723 of the Listing Manual, with 69.37% of shares held by the public. The upcoming AGM includes resolutions to remove and appoint directors, indicating potential shareholder activism related to the ongoing issues.

### 5. Risk Factors and Outlook

The management identifies various risks including economic downturns, competition, portfolio concentration, human capital, financial (FX fluctuations), supply chain, transitional (regulatory, energy prices, tech disruption, consumer preferences, reputation), and physical (extreme weather, water stress) risks (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Pages 97-100). The group's forward strategies focus on leveraging its Smart Factory, NPI team, diversifying customer base, and exploring eco-friendly materials and renewable energy, reflecting its climate risk and opportunity assessment (Table F.2.1, Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Pages 30-37). The installation of solar panels and efforts to transition to electric machinery are concrete steps towards sustainability goals.

The explicit mention of a 20% year-on-year increase in the order book by end of FY2024 (Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 6) and the expectation of increased business momentum in 2H2024, driven by new projects in high-precision segments, points to a cautiously optimistic outlook. However, this is predicated on "barring unforeseen circumstances," a common disclaimer that here carries significant weight due to the ongoing investigation and geopolitical uncertainties affecting supply chains.

### Conclusion

Fu Yu is navigating a critical juncture. The strategic divestment of the problematic SCS segment, coupled with a renewed focus and investment in the high-precision manufacturing core, appears to be yielding positive operational and financial results. The underlying manufacturing business shows improved margins and efficiency. However, the integrity and implications of the FYSCS investigation remain a material uncertainty, and the increase in recordable work-related injuries requires immediate attention to prevent future incidents and reputational damage. The company's commitment to sustainability and advanced manufacturing positions it well for long-term value creation, provided the ongoing governance issues are transparently and effectively resolved.
