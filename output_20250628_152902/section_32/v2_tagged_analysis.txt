    <h4>Investigation into Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS)</h4>
    <p>
        An internal audit report dated July 26, 2024, was received on August 7, 2024, for Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS) | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 178]. This report accorded FYSCS an overall assessment rating of "4" (Cause for considerable concern) | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 178] and highlighted significant weaknesses in FYSCS's risk management process that could expose the auditable unit to unacceptable levels of risk if left uncorrected | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 178].

    <p>
        In response, Damodara Ong LLC was engaged on October 8, 2024, to conduct an investigation into the affairs of FYSCS | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 178]. The Board received an Interim Status Update Report dated February 5, 2025, from Damodara Ong LLC | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 178]. This Interim Report highlighted several concerns:
        <ul>
            <li>One or more unverifiable arrangements regarding a payment of US$2,984,501 by FYSCS to a third party for which services did not appear to have been rendered, and potential conflict of interest issues | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 178].</li>
            <li>Unauthorized usage of the email account bd@fuyu-scs.com by third parties | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].</li>
            <li>Questions regarding the secondment of an individual to FYSCS as its general manager from May 2023 to May 2024 and the individual's conduct | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].</li>
            <li>Irregular expense claims made to FYSCS by a former employee for herself and on behalf of a current employee of the Company | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Subsequently, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd were appointed on February 11, 2025, to review, evaluate, investigate, and advise on issues mentioned in the Interim Report | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. Demand letters were sent by the Group's legal advisors, Nine Yards Chambers LLC, on April 1, 2025, to commence the process of pursuing claims | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. As of June 5, 2025, the Group intends to make claims against certain persons for FYC's acquisition of Avantgarde Enterprise Pte Ltd (now FYSCS) (AEPL Acquisition Claim) | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179], for purported misuse of FYSCS's resources (FYSCS Claim) | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179], and for the payment of a pre-paid commission of US$2,984,501 (Pre-Paid Commission Claim) | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. The investigation by Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd is still ongoing as of the date of the financial statements | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].
    </p>
    <p>
        The areas of concern raised were mainly related to the Supply Chain Management Services Segment, which ceased all business activities in the last quarter of FY2024 | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. The ongoing inquiry is isolated only to FYSCS and does not impact core manufacturing operations | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].
    </p>
    <p>
        The Board's opinion is that the internal controls and risk management systems of the Supply Chain Management Segment may be inadequate given the ongoing investigation | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. Due to this, the GCEO, COO, DCOO, and CFO are unable to provide any assurances on the Supply Chain Management Services Segment's internal controls and risk management systems | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. In contrast, for FY2024, the GCEO and CFO provided assurance that the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Manufacturing Segment's operations and finances | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. Furthermore, the GCEO, COO, DCOO, and CFO provided assurance for FY2024 that the Manufacturing Segment's risk management and internal control system are effective | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].
    </p>
    <p>
        The Group will continue to work on improving the internal controls and risk management at the respective subsidiary level for FYSCS given that the investigation has yet to complete its work | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179]. Upon conclusion of the investigation, the Group will review the findings and use its best efforts to resolve the areas of concern surrounding the investigation, and implement suitable improvements | [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 179].
