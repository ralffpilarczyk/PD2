### 2. Key Recent Trends

*   **Revenue Evolution:** Total revenue stagnated in FY2024 (0.5% growth to S$191.3M) after a significant 20.7% decline in FY2023. This stagnation was driven by the decline in the discontinued supply chain management services segment in 2H24, which offset healthy 10.5% growth in continuing operations (manufacturing) revenue to S$114.9M in FY2024. Manufacturing growth was particularly strong in 2H24 (up 17.2% to S$60.1M vs 2H23 S$51.3M), supported by new projects and higher order volumes.

*   **Margin Evolution:** EBITDA Margin for Continuing Operations showed substantial improvement in FY2024, reaching 7.4% from a very low 0.6% in FY2023, indicating enhanced operational efficiency. However, the interim trend is concerning: margins declined significantly in 2H24 (3.0%) compared to 1H24 (4.6%), and even more sharply compared to 1H23 (12.0%) and 2H23 (10.7%), pointing to margin pressure in the latter half of 2024 for the core business. Operating Margin (Continuing Operations) turned positive in FY2024 at 0.4% from a negative (7.1%) in FY2023. While 2H24 saw an operating margin of 1.4% (improvement over 1H24's (0.7%)), it still reflects challenges. Net Margin (Continuing Operations) remained negative in FY2024 at (1.1%), but significantly improved from (7.3%) in FY2023, though interim periods continued to show net losses (2H24: (0.9%), 1H24: (1.3%)).

*   **Cash Flow Generation:** Net Cash from Operating Activities reversed from a significant S$(4.5)M outflow in FY2023 to a positive S$3.6M inflow in FY2024, a critical improvement suggesting better working capital management. Strong 1H24 operating cash flow (S$3.6M) largely drove the full-year improvement, with 2H24 turning slightly negative (S$(0.1)M). Cash Conversion (OCF/EBITDA) improved dramatically from a highly negative (756.2%) in FY2023 to 42.4% in FY2024, though it remains below 100%. Variability across interim periods (142.8% in 1H24 vs. (3.1%) in 2H24) indicates fluctuations in cash management.

### 3. Performance Assessment

*   **Achievement vs. Guidance:** Management's FY2024 performance aligned with their outlook, reporting 0.5% total revenue growth (10.5% for continuing operations) and a significant narrowing of net loss from S$(10.1)M to S$(4.5)M [AR, p.8]. The Chairman highlighted a sharp narrowing of continuing operations net loss to S$1.2M from S$7.6M and an EBITDA increase "more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million from S$0.6 million" [AR, p.6]. For FY2025, the Group "remains optimistic... barring unforeseen circumstances" [Q424 Interim, p.29], supported by a 20% year-on-year increase in order book with high-precision projects ready for mass production [AR, p.6].

*   **Key Drivers of Performance:**
    *   **Manufacturing Segment Revival:** The core manufacturing business (continuing operations) showed strong revenue growth and improved gross margins, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, driven by new project wins and higher order volumes in medical and consumer segments [AR, p.9]. Gross profit margin for the manufacturing segment increased to 13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023 [AR, p.8], due to "lower expenses relating to employee costs, travelling expenses, water and electricity charges and sundry expenses" [AR, p.29].
    *   **Cost Management:** A 20.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses (FY2024 vs FY2023) significantly contributed to the narrowed losses [AR, p.29].
    *   **Strategic Transformation:** Investments in the Smart Factory, new product introduction (NPI) team, and advanced tooling have started to yield results, securing new customers and higher-margin projects [AR, p.6].

*   **Cash Flow Assessment (Continued):** The return to positive net operating cash flow in FY2024 (S$3.6M) from a significant outflow in FY2023 (S$(4.5)M) was mainly driven by "lower loss before tax for FY2024 and a decrease in inventories and trade and other receivables, offset by a reduction in trade and other payables" [AR, p.8]. Capital expenditure significantly ramped up in FY2024 (S$6.9M vs S$4.0M in FY2023), reflecting investments in "factory equipment, plant and machineries" [AR, p.9], which is a healthy sign for future growth if managed effectively. Despite this, cash and cash equivalents remained stable at around S$55.5M, maintaining a healthy balance sheet position.

*   **Industry Comparison:** The provided documents do not offer specific industry benchmarks. However, the narrative suggests a "challenging operating environment" [AR, p.6] and "slower-than-expected recovery in China's economy" [AR, p.9], implying a difficult external landscape where the Group's improvements stand out.

### 4. Management Discussion & Analysis (MDNA) Highlighting Key Recent Trends

**a. 2 Key Achievements**

1.  **Significant Turnaround in Core Manufacturing Profitability:** The Group achieved a remarkable shift in its continuing (manufacturing) operations, moving from an operating loss of S$(7.4)M in FY2023 to an operating profit of S$0.5M in FY2024 [AR, p.108], underpinned by a substantial increase in EBITDA from S$0.6M to S$8.5M [AR, p.8]. This turnaround demonstrates the effectiveness of strategic transformation, increased order volumes in medical and consumer segments, and diligent cost-containment measures [AR, p.6, p.9].
2.  **Successful Cessation of Underperforming Segment and Strengthening of Core Focus:** The Group proactively ceased all business activities in Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions (FYSCS) in Q4 FY2024 to reallocate resources to its core manufacturing business [AR, p.6]. While this incurred a goodwill impairment of S$3.3M [AR, p.6] and is subject to ongoing investigation, the strategic decision to exit a non-core, loss-making segment (FYSCS reported a loss of S$2.7M from discontinued operations in FY2024 [Q424 Interim, p.15]) is a positive step towards streamlining operations and sharpening focus on high-precision manufacturing.

**b. 2 Key Challenges**

1.  **Profitability Erosion in 2H2024 for Core Business:** Despite overall annual improvement, the core manufacturing segment experienced a significant decline in profitability in 2H24. EBITDA for the manufacturing segment dropped to S$1.8M in 2H24 from S$2.5M in 1H24 and S$5.5M in 2H23 [Q424 Interim, p.14]. Similarly, EBITDA margin for the manufacturing segment contracted from 1H23's 12.0% to 2H24's 3.0%. This indicates a concerning trend of margin compression for the continuing operations in the latter half of 2024, possibly due to pricing pressures, shifting product mix, or rising operational costs not fully offset by efficiency gains.
2.  **Operational Disruptions and Financial Fallout from Discontinued Operations:** The cessation of FYSCS, while strategically sound, unveiled significant underlying issues, including an internal audit report highlighting "significant weaknesses" and an ongoing investigation into "purported misuse of FYSCS's resources" and "irregular" expense claims, leading to a qualified audit opinion for FY2024 [AR, p.100, p.104]. Furthermore, the subsequent S$1.67M claim in favor of Evertree Hongkong Limited [AR, p.171] represents a tangible financial consequence. These events suggest past governance and operational failures in the discontinued segment, which incurred S$2.7M in losses from discontinued operations in FY2024 [Q424 Interim, p.15].

**c. 2 Areas of Disconnect between Management Statements and Actual Performance**

1.  **Discrepancy in EBITDA Reporting:** Management's "Financial Highlights" in the Annual Report states "EBITDA from Continuing Operations increased more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million from S$0.6 million" for FY2024 and FY2023 respectively [AR, p.8]. However, the "Reportable Segments" table in the Q424 Interim Financial Statements, which provides "Segment profit/ (loss) before tax*" (defined as excluding depreciation, impairment of goodwill, etc., a proxy for EBITDA), shows significantly different figures for the Manufacturing Segment (the continuing operation): S$4.37M for FY2024 and S$11.77M for FY2023 [Q424 Interim, p.14]. This inconsistency in defining and reporting a key non-GAAP metric creates confusion and questions the transparency of financial communication.
2.  **Downplaying the Severity of FYSCS Issues:** While the Chairman's Message mentions the S$3.3M one-off non-cash impairment of goodwill related to FYSCS and states the Board is "investigating the past affairs," it explicitly reiterates that "these investigations are isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations" [AR, p.6]. However, the independent auditor issued a *qualified opinion* specifically due to the "ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd," stating they "were unable to determine the potential financial impact, if any" [AR, p.104]. This qualified opinion, along with the subsequent arbitration ruling for S$1.67M, indicates a more significant, unresolved risk and financial impact than management's commentary suggests, potentially downplaying the severity and uncertainty associated with these past affairs.

### Data Sources and Methodologies

^19^ Continuing operations data for FY2022 and 2H22 were not separately reported in the provided documents due to business restructuring or reclassification. Interim data for 2H22 (except EOP Cash & Cash Equivalents) was not explicitly provided or calculable from the available annual and subsequent half-year data. EOP Cash & Cash Equivalents for 2H22 is the FY2022 year-end balance.
^20^ EBITDA for annual periods (FY2023, FY2024) are as directly stated in company's Financial Highlights [AR, p.8]. For interim periods, EBITDA is derived from "Segment profit/ (loss) before tax*" of the Manufacturing Segment [Q424 Interim, p.14], defined as "After excluding finance costs, foreign exchange gain/(loss) (net) and depreciation". This is considered a proxy for EBITDA from Continuing Operations. Note the substantial discrepancy between company-reported annual EBITDA figures and figures derived from segment reporting.
^21^ Cash Conversion is calculated as Net Cash from Operating Activities / EBITDA (Continuing Operations). While the requirement specified "EBITDA / (EBITDA/Capex)" (which simplifies to Capex), OCF/EBITDA is used as a more standard and meaningful measure of cash conversion.
*   **Primary Sources:** Annual Report (AR) for FY2022-FY2024 annual data, and Q424 Interim Financial Statements (Q424 Interim) for interim periods.
*   **Calculated Metrics:** All 1H (e.g., 1H23, 1H24) figures are calculated by subtracting the corresponding 2H period from the full financial year total. Margins (EBITDA Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, Capex % of Revenue) are calculated by dividing the relevant profit/cash flow metric by Revenue (Continuing Operations). Percentages are rounded to one decimal place. Specific calculations were verified against original source data.
