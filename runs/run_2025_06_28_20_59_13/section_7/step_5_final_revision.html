    </ul>

    <h4>Key Recent Trends</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue Transition and Shift:</strong> After a significant decline from FY2022 (S$240.1M) to FY2023 (S$190.4M), consolidated revenue remained relatively stable in FY2024 at S$191.3M. This stability, however, masks a strategic shift and significant intra-year dynamics. A 10.5% increase in continuing manufacturing operations revenue (S$103.9M to S$114.9M) was largely offset by a decline in the discontinued supply chain management services (S$86.4M to S$76.4M)<sup>[1]</sup>. The cessation of the supply chain segment in Q4 2024 fundamentally alters the revenue base; future revenue will be purely from manufacturing. The 2H2024 saw a sharp 45.8% drop in consolidated revenue (from S$126.7M in 1H2024 to S$64.6M in 2H2024), predominantly due to the accelerated winding down of the supply chain business in the latter half of the year, establishing a significantly lower, but higher-quality, revenue baseline for the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Profitability Improvement:</strong> The Group demonstrated a significant turnaround in overall profitability. Consolidated Net Loss narrowed substantially from S$(10.1)M in FY2023 to S$(3.9)M in FY2024. This improvement is driven by a strong rebound in operating income and EBITDA, particularly in the continuing manufacturing segment, indicating the early success of its strategic transformation.</li>
        <li><strong>EBITDA Rebound:</strong> Consolidated EBITDA saw a remarkable increase, from S$1.6M in FY2023 to S$10.4M in FY2024. This signals improved operational efficiency and cost management. The positive trend is evident in the interim periods, with EBITDA growing consistently from S$413k in 1H2023 to S$4.8M in 1H2024 and S$5.6M in 2H2024. This rebound is particularly strong in the continuing operations segment, which saw its EBITDA increase more than 14-fold from S$0.6M to S$8.5M, a key driver of overall improvement<sup>[21]</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Focus on Manufacturing:</strong> The higher sales volumes in Singapore and Malaysia manufacturing operations, coupled with new project wins in biomedical and consumer segments, indicate the early successes of the Group's strategic transformation to focus on high-precision manufacturing, validating the "five pillars of transformation unveiled in FY2023"<sup>[19][26]</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Capex:</strong> Capital expenditure significantly increased from S$3.96M in FY2023 to S$6.94M in FY2024, primarily for factory equipment, plant, and machinery, reflecting deliberate investments in strengthening manufacturing capabilities and automation<sup>[14]</sup>. This increased investment aligns with the strategic pivot towards higher-precision manufacturing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, while the full-year consolidated results show a continued net loss, the underlying trends, particularly in 2H2024, suggest a successful strategic transition towards a leaner, higher-margin manufacturing-focused business.</p>

    <h4>Margin Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gross Margin Evolution:</strong> Consolidated Gross Margin improved from 7.0% in FY2023 to 8.9% in FY2024. The manufacturing segment's gross profit margin specifically improved from 11.7% to 13.5%<sup>[20]</sup>. This indicates better pricing power or cost control within the core business. Interim periods demonstrate a significant shift: 1H2024 consolidated GPM was 6.7% compared to a much stronger 13.1% in 2H2024. This dramatic improvement in the latter half of the year is a direct reflection of the change in revenue mix as the lower-margin supply chain business phased out, leaving a higher proportion of revenue from the more profitable manufacturing segment. The Chairman's message highlights that core manufacturing gross profit increased 27.5% in FY2024, outpacing revenue growth, signifying successful focus on higher-margin activities<sup>[20]</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating and EBITDA Margin Turnaround:</strong> Consolidated Operating Margin improved from -5.2% in FY2023 to -1.1% in FY2024, indicating a substantial reduction in operating losses. EBITDA Margin saw a significant jump from 0.8% in FY2023 to 5.4% in FY2024. This is a crucial indicator of improving underlying operational performance before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The continuing operations segment specifically saw EBITDA increase more than 14-fold from S$0.6M to S$8.5M<sup>[21]</sup>, confirming the positive impact of the strategic realignment on core profitability.</li>
        <li><strong>Net Margin Improvement:</strong> While still negative, the consolidated Net Margin improved from -5.3% in FY2023 to -2.0% in FY2024. This narrowing of net loss signals clear progress towards overall profitability, supported by improved gross margins and lower selling and administrative expenses, which decreased by 20.4% in FY2024<sup>[22]</sup>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The consistent improvement in margins, especially in 2H2024, underscores the positive impact of the Group's strategic pivot towards its higher-margin manufacturing core, suggesting a stronger foundation for future profitability.</p>

    <h4>Cash Flow Assessment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Return to Positive Operating Cash Flow:</strong> A significant achievement is the return to positive net operating cash inflow of S$3.6M in FY2024, a sharp reversal from an S$(4.5)M outflow in FY2023<sup>[16]</sup>. This was mainly due to the lower loss before tax and a decrease in inventories and trade receivables, offset by a reduction in trade payables<sup>[23]</sup>. This indicates improving working capital management and an enhanced ability to generate cash from core operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Investing Activities:</strong> Net cash used in investing activities increased from S$2.0M in FY2023 to S$5.1M in FY2024 due to higher capital expenditure in factory equipment and machinery<sup>[24]</sup>. This aligns with the strategic objective of enhancing manufacturing capabilities and positions the company for future growth within its core business.</li>
        <li><strong>Net Cash Position:</strong> Despite increased capex and overall net loss, the Group maintained a healthy net cash position of S$55.5M as at 31 December 2024, equivalent to 7.3 cents per share<sup>[25]</sup>. This strong liquidity provides significant financial flexibility for future investments and navigating ongoing economic uncertainties.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Conversion (OCF/EBITDA):</strong> The OCF/EBITDA ratio improved dramatically from -281.3% in FY2023 (due to negative OCF and low EBITDA) to 34.6% in FY2024, indicating a much better conversion of operational profits into cash. This is particularly strong in 1H2024 (76.1%), showing robust cash generation from the continuing operations. However, the negative OCF/EBITDA of -1.0% in 2H2024, despite positive EBITDA for the period, suggests a potential reversal or significant one-off working capital outflow in the latter half of the year. This could be related to the winding down of the supply chain business (e.g., settlement of liabilities, inventory clearance at unfavorable terms, or timing of significant payments), indicating that granular analysis of interim balance sheets is critical to pinpointing the exact drivers of such cash consumption. (Note: The "Cash conversion (EBITDA / (EBITDA/Capex))" formula simplifies mathematically to 'Capex' and is thus less relevant for assessing how much operational profit converts to actual cash.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The significant rebound to positive operating cash flow for the full year, coupled with a robust net cash position, provides Fu Yu with considerable financial strength to execute its strategic objectives, though the 2H2024 cash flow warrants closer monitoring for its underlying drivers.</p>

    <h4>Industry Comparison (Placeholder)</h4>
    <p>To fully contextualize Fu Yu's financial performance, a comparison against industry averages and key peers in the high-precision manufacturing sector is essential. While specific peer data is beyond the scope of this immediate analysis, typical benchmarks for the industry could include gross margins in the 15-25% range and EBITDA margins typically falling within 8-15%, depending on product complexity, automation levels, and market served. Fu Yu's current margins, particularly its 2H2024 gross margin of 13.1% and FY2024 EBITDA margin of 5.4%, suggest that while significant improvements have been made, there may still be room for further margin expansion towards industry leading practices, especially as the Group fully transitions to its higher-value manufacturing core.

    <h4>2 Key Achievements</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Successful Strategic Transformation and Profitability Turnaround:</strong> As detailed in the "Profitability Improvement" and "EBITDA Rebound" sections, the Group's strategic focus on high-precision manufacturing, coupled with significant operational improvements, has led to a remarkable turnaround in profitability for its continuing operations. Revenue from manufacturing grew by 10.5% in FY2024, and crucially, EBITDA from continuing operations surged more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million in FY2024 from S$0.6 million in FY2023, while net loss from continuing operations narrowed sharply from S$7.6 million to S$1.2 million<sup>[21]</sup>. This demonstrates the early success of their "five pillars of transformation unveiled in FY2023"<sup>[26]</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Return to Positive Operating Cash Flow and Robust Liquidity:</strong> Building on the analysis in the "Cash Flow Assessment," the Group successfully generated a positive net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024, reversing the S$(4.5) million outflow in FY2023. This signals improved working capital management and healthy cash generation from core activities. The Group also maintained a strong net cash balance of S$55.5 million, providing a solid financial foundation for future growth and resilience amidst a challenging economic landscape<sup>[25]</sup>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2 Key Challenges</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Discontinuation of Supply Chain Management Services and Associated Financial Impact:</strong> The Group's strategic decision to cease all business activities in its supply chain arm (FYSCS) resulted in significant one-off impairment charges and ongoing losses from discontinued operations, contributing to the overall consolidated net loss. While a strategic move to reallocate resources to core manufacturing, this segment incurred a loss of S$2.67M in FY2024 (S$2.51M in FY2023) and a goodwill impairment of S$3.29M in FY2024, which impacted overall financial performance<sup>[27]</sup>. Furthermore, the ongoing investigation into FYSCS's past affairs by external professionals, highlighting "significant weaknesses" and "unverifiable arrangements," presents a material legal and reputational challenge that needs to be resolved<sup>[28]</sup>.</li>
        <li><strong>Geopolitical Uncertainties and China Operations Downturn:</strong> The operating landscape is expected to remain challenging due to geopolitical uncertainty and potential escalation of US-China trade tensions<sup>[29]</sup>. This is reflected in the decline of revenue contribution from China operations by 11.8% in FY2024 and a continued loss before tax of S$4.3 million in FY2024, up from S$3.8 million in FY2023 for the China segment<sup>[30]</sup>. The Group acknowledges the need to evolve revenue contribution by location, moving production away from China to offer geographical flexibility, which is a significant strategic and operational undertaking<sup>[29]</sup>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Consolidated Profitability vs. H1 Guidance:</strong> The 1H2024 results briefing presented a "net profit of S$0.1M" for 1H2024 and stated that overall "financial performance for FY2025 will improve compared to FY2024"<sup>[7][31]</sup>. While the 1H2024 did indeed show a slight net profit, the full-year consolidated net loss was S$(3.9)M. This indicates that the positive momentum seen in 1H was significantly eroded in 2H, with a net loss of S$(3.96)M in 2H2024, despite the initial "optimistic" outlook. The sharp 45.8% drop in 2H2024 consolidated revenue, largely driven by the accelerated winding down of the supply chain business, created a significant shift that impacted full-year results more negatively than the 1H results might have suggested. Management should provide a more granular explanation of the specific factors that led to this 2H deterioration, especially given the significant positive shift in gross margins in 2H.</li>
        <li><strong>EBITDA from Continuing Operations vs. Consolidated EBITDA:</strong> Management consistently highlights the significant improvement in "EBITDA from continuing operations" (e.g., S$8.5M in FY2024 from S$0.6M in FY2023) as a key indicator of operational progress<sup>[21]</sup>. However, the *consolidated* EBITDA of S$10.4M for FY2024 is notably higher than that of continuing operations (S$8.5M). This implies that the *discontinued operations actually contributed positive EBITDA of S$1.9M* in FY2024 (S$10.4M consolidated EBITDA - S$8.5M continuing operations EBITDA). This challenges the narrative that the discontinued segment was solely an operational drag. While it was a net income drag (due to non-cash goodwill impairment and other factors), its core operations, before these charges, contributed positively to EBITDA during its phase-out. This nuance provides a more sophisticated understanding of the company's operational trajectory and the actual EBITDA profile of the ongoing business. It suggests that the future operational efficiency of the *manufacturing segment alone* must be exceptionally strong to compensate for both the net income losses and any positive EBITDA contribution from the disposed segment.</li>
