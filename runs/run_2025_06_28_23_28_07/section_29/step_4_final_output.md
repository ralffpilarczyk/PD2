## SECTION 29: Buyside Due Diligence - Operating Performance

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's financial narrative presents a dual challenge: nascent recovery in its core manufacturing segment, set against a backdrop of significant prior Group losses and severe audit qualifications on its discontinued Supply Chain Management Services segment[^3]. While the focus on "continuing operations" (manufacturing) is appropriate for assessing future viability, the magnitude of the S$7.6 million net loss in FY2023 (narrowed to S$1.2 million in FY2024) and the audit issues on the SCM segment[^3] fundamentally impact the group's overall financial health and investor perception. This analysis therefore critically examines the manufacturing segment's performance, seeking to identify the *quality* and *sustainability* of reported improvements, particularly in the absence of robust external benchmarking.

### 1. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Period | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | Manufacturing Gross Profit (S$ Million) | Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (%) | Source |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----- |
| 1H 2023 | 52.6 | 6.4 | 12.17% | [^7] |
| 2H 2023 | 51.3 | 5.9 | 11.56% | [^5] |
| FY 2023 | 103.9 | 12.1 | 11.7% | [^4] |
| 1H 2024 | 54.8 | 8.5 | 15.51% | [^7] |
| 2H 2024 | 60.1 | 8.5 | 14.08% | [^5] |
| FY 2024 | 114.9 | 15.5 | 13.5% | [^4] |

**Benchmarking:**
Quantitative GPM benchmarking against key competitors or industry averages is unavailable from provided documents. This represents a critical information gap for assessing Fu Yu's relative operational efficiency and competitive standing; improvements lack external validation.

**Analysis:**
Manufacturing GPM improved from 11.7% (FY2023) to 13.5% (FY2024), a 1.8 percentage point (ppt) increase. This translated into a S$3.4 million (28.1%) increase in manufacturing gross profit (S$12.1M to S$15.5M) [^4], significantly contributing to narrowing the net loss from continuing operations to S$1.2 million (FY2024) [^13]. However, a critical observation is the peak at 15.51% in 1H 2024 followed by a 1.43 ppt dip to 14.08% in 2H 2024. While management cites "New, Higher-Margin Projects" and "Strategic Initiatives" [^2] along with "Cost Management" [^11] as drivers for the improvement, the intra-year decline warrants deeper analysis (e.g., product mix shift, input cost fluctuations, or re-ramping of initial lower-margin phases for new projects). The analysis does not quantify the specific contribution of new projects (indicating genuinely higher unit economics) versus cost management (which can be one-off or signal underlying pressures, such as reduced employee costs through layoffs versus sustainable efficiency gains). Reduced employee expenses, in particular, require scrutiny. The GPM trend's sustainability is uncertain given the 2H 2024 dip. While new, high-precision projects are transitioning to mass production and are expected to yield "long-term sustainable revenue" due to their "sticky" nature [^1], the volatility raises concerns about margin consistency. The company needs to provide a clear explanation for the 2H 2024 GPM contraction for a buyside investor to have confidence in the "sustainable" narrative.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What specific initiatives and pricing strategies led to the 3.34 ppt GPM increase (2H 2023 to 1H 2024) and the subsequent 1.43 ppt decrease (1H 2024 to 2H 2024)?
2.  Can management provide a breakdown of manufacturing GPM by product category (e.g., life sciences, medical, consumer) or new vs. existing projects to assess margin quality and sustainability?
3.  Given the absence of public data, can the Company provide proprietary benchmarking data (e.g., average industry GPM for similar precision engineering firms) to assess its competitive position?

### 2. Manufacturing Revenue Growth

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Period | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | YoY Growth (%) | Source |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- | :------------- | :----- |
| 1H 2023 | 52.6 | - | [^7] |
| 2H 2023 | 51.3 | - | [^6] |
| FY 2023 | 103.9 | - | [^4] |
| 1H 2024 | 54.8 | 4.2% | [^7] |
| 2H 2024 | 60.1 | 17.1% | [^6] |
| FY 2024 | 114.9 | 10.5% | [^4] |

**Benchmarking:**
Explicit industry average or competitor revenue growth rates are not provided, representing a critical gap for assessing Fu Yu's market penetration and relative growth performance.

**Analysis:**
Manufacturing revenue grew 10.5% (S$103.9M FY2023 to S$114.9M FY2024), accelerating to 17.1% in 2H 2024. This top-line expansion contributed S$11.0 million in additional revenue. Combined with improved gross margins, this was a primary driver in reducing the Group's net loss from continuing operations from S$7.6 million (FY2023) to S$1.2 million (FY2024) [^13]. Drivers include "New Project Wins" in biomedical, consumer, drone, and smart appliance segments [^2], [^14], along with "Higher Existing Customer Orders" [^1]. A key strategic shift is the "Geographical Shift": Singapore and Malaysia sales improved 20.9% and 24.9% respectively [^15], which successfully "offset an 11.8% China decline" [^1]. While framed as "diversifying from geopolitical risks," the decline in China warrants deeper inquiry: Was this a strategic withdrawal from a less profitable or riskier market, or a loss of market share due to heightened competition or reduced demand in a key region? If the latter, it signals underlying market weakness that diversification merely masks rather than negates. Manufacturing revenue growth appears potentially sustainable, supported by a 20% YoY increase in the FY2024 order book, providing a solid base for FY2025 [^1]. The strategic focus on high-precision, higher-margin sectors (medical devices, consumer products) and geographical diversification (away from China) enhances stability [^1]. The readiness of new high-precision projects for mass production after prototyping and mold development is a positive sign for future volumes [^1]. However, the "quality" of the order book (e.g., firm, non-cancellable contracts vs. projected orders) needs to be assessed to validate future growth projections.

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  Given the 20% YoY increase in the FY2024 order book, what is the projected manufacturing revenue growth for FY2025, and how much is secured via long-term contracts?
2.  What is the specific revenue contribution from "higher-margin product categories" (e.g., medical, biomedical) relative to total manufacturing revenue, and what strategies are planned to increase this mix?
3.  Can the Company provide proprietary benchmarking data (e.g., average industry revenue growth rates for similar precision engineering firms) to assess its relative market performance?

### 3. Manufacturing Energy Intensity

**Historical Data (Last 24 Months):**

| Period | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) | Manufacturing Revenue (S$ Million) | Energy Intensity (GJ/S$ Million Revenue) | Source |
| :----- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----- |
| FY 2023 | 118,698.7 | 103.9 | 1,142.4 | [^8] |
| FY 2024 | 119,942.0 | 114.9 | 1,043.9 | [^8] |

**Benchmarking:**
No energy intensity benchmarks for competitors or the broader industry are provided, posing a critical gap for evaluating Fu Yu's relative operational efficiency and cost competitiveness.

**Analysis:**
Energy Intensity improved 8.6% from 1,142.4 GJ/S$mil (FY2023) to 1,043.9 GJ/S$mil (FY2024) [^8]. This is driven by "Energy-Efficient Machinery" (replacement of hydraulic with electric machinery) and "Operational Optimization" (reduced machinery idling time) [^12]. Additionally, "Renewable Energy Transition" (solar panel installation in Singapore, planned in Malaysia) [^16] is contributing. Crucially, while *intensity* reduced, *absolute* energy consumption *increased* from 118,698.7 GJ (FY2023) to 119,942.0 GJ (FY2024). This increase, likely driven by higher production volumes concurrent with revenue growth, means that total energy *costs* for the company still likely increased, albeit at a slower rate than revenue. The 8.6% energy intensity reduction in FY2024 signifies more efficient energy use. While "direct monetary savings are not quantified" by the company [^12], a buyside analysis estimates this to represent a saving of approximately 11,329 GJ (had intensity remained at FY2023 levels). Assuming an average energy cost of S$50/GJ (illustrative), this translates to an estimated **S$566,450 in energy cost savings for FY2024 attributable to improved efficiency**. This efficiency is crucial for cost competitiveness amid increasing electricity rates and carbon taxes [^18], demonstrating a tangible, though unstated, financial benefit. Energy intensity improvements are highly probable, being part of a "broader sustainability strategy" [^17]. Continued solar panel rollout in Malaysia and machinery replacement initiatives are expected to yield further gains [^16], [^12]. However, the net financial benefit hinges on the continued efficiency gains outpacing increases in absolute consumption and rising energy prices/carbon taxes [^18].

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1.  What is the projected energy intensity for FY2025, considering full operationalization of Malaysian solar panels and planned machinery upgrades?
2.  What are the estimated cost savings (S$ thousands) directly from the 8.6% intensity improvement in FY2024, and what is the target for future savings?
3.  Can the Company provide proprietary benchmarking data on energy intensity for similar manufacturing peers to assess its relative efficiency and cost competitiveness?
