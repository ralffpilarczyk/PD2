### c. Disconnects between Strategic Objectives and Corporate Strategies

While the Group presents a cohesive strategic narrative, several potential disconnects and areas for critical evaluation emerge:

1.  **Financial Performance vs. "Growth Trajectory" (Optimistic Claims):**
    *   **Claim:** The Chairman's message states the Group is "clearly on a growth trajectory" for FY2025, with a 20% increase in order book by end of FY2024 [1, p.5]. Manufacturing revenue did increase by 10.5% and net loss from continuing operations narrowed significantly from S$7.6M to S$1.2M in FY2024 [1, p.8].
    *   **Challenge:** Despite these improvements, the Group remains in a net loss position for FY2024 (S$3.9 million overall, S$1.2 million from continuing operations) [1, p.8]. The Q4 FY2024 results show a *decrease* in Group-wide revenue for 2H24 (down 45.8% to S$64.6M from S$119.2M in 2H23), mainly due to the supply chain management services segment cessation, indicating that the overall revenue picture is still volatile [2, p.4]. The optimistic "growth trajectory" needs to be contextualized against the current loss-making status and the overall revenue decline in 2H24.

2.  **China Operations Performance vs. Multi-Geographical Strategy:**
    *   **Strategy:** Leveraging multi-geographical footprint to offer flexibility and reduce reliance on single regions, especially as customers seek to source away from China [1, p.5].
    *   **Disconnect:** While presented as a strategic advantage, the China operations saw a revenue *decline* of 11.8% to S$32.1 million in FY2024 and recorded an increased loss before tax of S$4.3 million (vs. S$3.8 million in FY2023) [1, p.9]. This suggests that while geographical diversification is a sound strategy in theory, the current execution and economic environment in China are presenting significant challenges, potentially undermining the overall benefit of the multi-country footprint in practice. The shift to "China-for-China and China-for-Asia strategies" [2, p.28] is an adaptation, implying challenges in serving ex-China markets from their Chinese facilities.

3.  **Sustainability Targets vs. Achievement (Execution Gap):**
    *   **Objective:** Short-term target to reduce Scope 2 carbon emissions by 3.0% in FY2024 [1, p.41].
    *   **Disconnect:** The Group achieved only a 1.4% reduction in Scope 2 carbon emissions in FY2024, falling short of its stated target [1, p.41]. While there's progress, this indicates a gap between aspiration and actual execution in a key strategic area.

4.  **Workplace Safety Objective vs. Performance:**
    *   **Objective:** Committed to achieving a "zero-workplace incident rate" [1, p.60].
    *   **Disconnect:** The recordable work-related injuries rate increased from 3.5 in FY2023 to 4.6 in FY2024 [1, p.60]. This shows a direct contradiction between the stated objective and the actual safety performance, raising questions about the effectiveness of current safety measures or their implementation.

5.  **Timing and Nature of Supply Chain Management Services Cessation (Red Flag):**
    *   **Strategy (Narrative):** The cessation of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd ("FYSCS") was presented as a strategic decision to "reallocate resources to our core manufacturing business" [1, p.5].
    *   **Challenge (What's NOT being said/Timing):** This cessation coincided with an internal audit report (dated 26 July 2024, received 7 August 2024) highlighting "significant weaknesses" and "unacceptable levels of risk" within FYSCS's risk management process. An ongoing investigation by external professionals (Damodara Ong LLC, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd) was initiated in late 2024/early 2025 due to "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of the email," and "irregular expense claims" [1, p.5, 10, 104, 105; 2, p.15].
        *   The external auditor issued a *qualified opinion* on the FY2024 financial statements due to the inability to determine the "potential financial impact" of this ongoing investigation to the Group [1, p.104].
        *   The Board explicitly states it is "unable to give their views on the ongoing investigation" [1, p.100] and that internal controls for this segment "may be inadequate" [1, p.99].
        *   This strongly suggests that the cessation was not purely a proactive strategic reallocation but potentially a forced exit or resource withdrawal in response to severe internal control issues and financial irregularities. The timing of the cessation (Q4 FY2024) immediately after internal audit findings is a significant red flag, implying risks were being downplayed as strategic decisions.
