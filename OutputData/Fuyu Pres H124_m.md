## **New Projects and Collaborations**

#### **New Project Wins**

In 1H2024, Fu Yu secured project with an international biomedical company to produce microfluidic chips (used in medical diagnostic devices)

Signed partnership with a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation to produce high-precision tools used to manufacture drug delivery devices

Group signed an MoU in 1Q2024 to be the exclusive plastics supplier for a local medical device manufacturer; both parties will also collaborate to target MedTech companies

# **Conclusion & Outlook**

#### **Industry Outlook**

Several headwinds could hamper pace of recovery: longer shipping lead times, higher costs of raw materials and further disruptions to the supply chain, arising from geopolitical tensions

US election run-up could further escalate US-China trade tensions; in response, Fu Yu's facilities in China are focused on China-for-China and China-for-Asia strategies

#### **Group Outlook**

Fu Yu recorded higher-order volumes and inquiries for new projects; business momentum expected to grow in 2H2024

Strategic initiatives to enhance manufacturing capabilities and expand customer base is bearing early fruits; Group will continue to execute its corporate strategies in the coming months
