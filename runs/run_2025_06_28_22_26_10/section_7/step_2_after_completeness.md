## SECTION 7: Summary Financials (Consolidated)

### 1. Executive Summary

Fu Yu Corporation Limited (the "Group") experienced a mixed financial performance, with its core Manufacturing segment showing resilience and growth, particularly in FY2024. This analysis focuses on key financial metrics for the last three fiscal years and four most recent interim periods, drawing primarily from the company's financial disclosures. While efforts have been made to extract all available data, specific industry comparison data was not provided in the source material, and data for a fifth interim period (e.g., H1 or H2 2022) was not available. Overall consolidated results have been significantly impacted by the cessation and financial irregularities of the Supply Chain Management Services segment (FYSCS), leading to an auditor's qualified opinion on the financial statements for FY2024. While the Manufacturing segment returned to profitability in FY2024, the consolidated Group remained in a net loss position, albeit narrowed. Cash flow from operations improved, but substantial capital expenditures and ongoing investigations present both opportunities and risks for future performance.

#### c. Key Recent Trends

1.  **Revenue Shift & Growth:** Overall Group revenue saw a slight increase in FY2024 compared to FY2023, primarily driven by strong growth in the Manufacturing segment (up 10.5% in FY2024). The Supply Chain Management Services segment (FYSCS) saw a decline in revenue and was discontinued in Q4 FY2024, leading to a significant 45.8% drop in overall Group revenue in 2H2024. The core manufacturing business, however, demonstrated consistent quarterly growth throughout FY2024 (S$52.6M in 1H23 to S$60.1M in 2H24).
2.  **Profitability Turnaround (Manufacturing):** The Manufacturing segment (continuing operations) made a notable shift from a substantial loss before tax of S\$8.1 million in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S\$0.15 million in FY2024 (AR p.108). This was largely due to higher revenue and a significant reduction in selling and administrative expenses (down 20.4%). EBITDA from continuing operations also increased dramatically from S$0.6M in FY2023 to S$8.5M in FY2024.
3.  **Consolidated Loss & Discontinuation Impact:** Despite the manufacturing segment's recovery, the consolidated Group recorded a net loss of S\$3.9 million in FY2024, though sharply narrowed from S\$10.1 million in FY2023. This consolidated loss is primarily attributable to the loss from discontinued operations (FYSCS), which accounted for S\$2.7 million in FY2024 (FS Q424 p.4). The discontinuation and related impairments significantly weighed on the overall financial results.
4.  **Improving Margins (Post-FYSCS):** The Group's gross profit margin improved from 7.0% in FY2023 to 8.9% in FY2024 (AR p.7). The Manufacturing segment's gross margin specifically improved from 11.7% to 13.5% (AR p.7). This trend is expected to continue as the low-margin FYSCS business is removed from the consolidated results. EBITDA margin for continuing operations also saw a significant jump, reflecting improved operational efficiency.

#### d. Cash Flow Assessment

1.  **Operating Cash Flow Improvement:** The Group successfully transitioned from a net operating cash outflow of S\$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S\$3.6 million in FY2024 (AR p.111, FS Q424 p.10). This positive shift indicates better working capital management (decrease in inventories and trade receivables) and a reduction in operational losses in continuing operations.
2.  **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Capex significantly increased from S\$4.0 million in FY2023 to S\$6.9 million in FY2024, representing a higher percentage of total revenue (from 2.1% to 3.6%). This reflects strategic investments in factory equipment, plant, and machinery, particularly for the Smart Factory in Singapore (AR p.9, Pres H124 p.9). This aligns with management's stated focus on high-precision manufacturing.
3.  **Cash Conversion Fluctuations:** Cash conversion (Net Operating Cash Flow / Total Group EBITDA) was highly negative in FY2023 due to significant operating cash outflows and low EBITDA. It recovered to 37.4% for FY2024, indicating improved efficiency in converting earnings into cash. However, the 2H24 period saw a slight operating cash outflow, resulting in negative cash conversion for that specific half, reflecting potential transition impacts.
4.  **Strong Net Cash Position:** Despite the losses and investments, the Group maintained a healthy net cash position of S\$55.5 million as at 31 December 2024 (AR p.8, FS Q424 p.3). This provides financial flexibility for ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.

#### e. Industry Context (Qualitative)

While specific competitor or industry benchmark data was not available within the provided documents, it is generally acknowledged that the precision manufacturing sector operates within a highly competitive landscape, characterized by demand for high quality, efficiency, and continuous technological investment. Fu Yu's reported manufacturing segment gross margin of 13.5% in FY2024, and the significant improvement in EBITDA margin for continuing operations to 7.4%, suggest a positive trend in operational efficiency that, when viewed in isolation, indicates a solid return to core business profitability. However, without direct industry comparisons, it is challenging to definitively assess if these margins are above, below, or in line with industry averages for similar high-precision manufacturing services. The increased capital expenditure aligns with the industry's need for ongoing investment in advanced machinery to maintain competitiveness and pursue higher-value projects.

### 3. MDNA Highlighting Key Recent Trends

#### a. 2 Key Achievements

1.  **Successful Turnaround of Core Manufacturing Business (FY2024):** The Group's strategic transformation efforts have clearly paid off in its core manufacturing segment. Revenue grew by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, driven by new projects in biomedical and consumer segments and higher order volumes from existing customers (Chairman's Message, AR p.6; Financial Highlights, AR p.7). More impressively, the manufacturing segment reversed a significant loss before tax of S$8.1 million in FY2023 to a profit before tax of S$0.15 million in FY2024 (FS Q424 p.4). This achievement is a direct result of "advanced tooling with high precision and the introduction of our New Product Introduction ("NPI") team" (Chairman's Message, AR p.6). This shift validates their focus on high-precision manufacturing.
2.  **Significant Improvement in Operational Efficiency and Cash Flow Generation:** Selling and administrative expenses for continuing operations decreased by a substantial 20.4% in FY2024, contributing to the improved profitability (Financial Highlights, AR p.7). Concurrently, the Group successfully converted a net operating cash outflow of S$4.5 million in FY2023 to a net operating cash inflow of S$3.6 million in FY2024 (AR p.9, FS Q424 p.10). This indicates enhanced working capital management and cost containment, crucial for sustainable operations amidst challenging environments.

#### b. 2 Key Challenges

1.  **Discontinuation and Financial Impact of Supply Chain Segment (FYSCS):** The Group ceased all business activities in its supply chain management services segment (FYSCS) in Q4 FY2024 due to the "inability to identify a suitable candidate to effectively run and manage the business" (FS Q424 p.26). This decision led to a significant loss from discontinued operations of S$2.7 million in FY2024, impacting overall consolidated profitability (FS Q44 p.4). This reflects challenges in talent acquisition and strategic execution for non-core businesses.
2.  **Ongoing Investigation and Audit Qualification Related to FYSCS:** The external auditor issued a "Qualified Opinion" on the FY2024 financial statements specifically due to an "ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd" (Independent Auditor's Report, AR p.104). The investigation highlights serious concerns including "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of the email account," and "irregular expense claims" (Directors' Statement, AR p.100; FS Q424 p.28). This poses a significant reputational risk and potential financial liabilities from "claims against certain persons" (AR p.100, Note 32). The lack of full clarity on these financial impacts is a major overhang.

#### c. 2 Areas of Disconnect Between Management Statements and Actual Performance/Data

1.  **Management's Portrayal vs. Auditor's Qualification on FYSCS:**
    *   **Management Statement:** The Chairman's message positively frames the cessation of FYSCS as a strategic move to "reallocate resources to our core manufacturing business" and that "these investigations are isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations" (Chairman's Message, AR p.6). The interim report also states the cessation was due to "inability to identify a suitable candidate" (FS Q424 p.26).
    *   **Actual Performance/Data Disconnect:** The auditor's qualified opinion directly contradicts the "isolated" narrative by stating they "were unable to determine the potential financial impact, if any, to the Group and the Company in respect of the Claims which pertain to FYSCS" (Independent Auditor's Report, AR p.104). The extensive detail of alleged "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage of email," and "irregular expense claims" (FS Q424 p.28) points to a far more serious issue than just an inability to find a manager. The S$3.3M goodwill impairment in FY2024 for FYSCS (AR p.6) directly preceded its cessation, suggesting underlying issues were already present. The management's optimistic framing appears to downplay the severity of the FYSCS issues and their potential lingering financial and reputational implications for the broader Group.
2.  **Revenue Growth Narrative vs. Consolidated Topline Stagnation:**
    *   **Management Statement:** The Chairman's message highlights "revenue from our continuing operations (manufacturing) grew by 10.5% to S$114.9 million in FY2024" (AR p.6). The 1H2024 review also states "Group-wide revenue rose 78.0%, propelled by higher sales for both manufacturing and supply chain management segments" (Pres H124 p.5). The FY2025 outlook forecasts a "20% year-on-year" increase in order book and overall "financial performance... will improve" (FS Q424 p.31).
    *   **Actual Performance/Data Disconnect:** While the manufacturing segment indeed grew, the *total consolidated Group revenue* only increased by a marginal 0.5% for FY2024 (AR p.7). The significant 78.0% growth in 1H2024 was heavily influenced by the volatile FYSCS segment which then drastically declined in 2H2024, causing the overall 2H2024 Group revenue to drop by 45.8% (FS Q424 p.4). The emphasis on manufacturing growth is accurate for the segment, but the overall top-line for the group is largely stagnant year-on-year, and showed a steep decline in 2H2024 due to strategic decisions about FYSCS. The forward-looking optimism for FY2025, while linked to manufacturing order book, does not explicitly address how the absence of the (albeit problematic) FYSCS revenue, or the potential financial impact of the FYSCS investigation, will factor into the overall Group's "improved financial performance". This suggests a selective focus on positive aspects while the consolidated financial picture remains challenging.
