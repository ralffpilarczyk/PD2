## SECTION 5: Key Competitors

Maxis Berhad operates in Malaysia's highly competitive telecommunications sector, positioning itself as a "leading integrated telco" across mobile, home, and enterprise segments. External competitive analysis is challenging due to limited direct comparative data in Maxis's disclosures.

### Key Competitors and Strategic Dynamics

1.  **CelcomDigi:** The late 2022 merger created Malaysia's largest mobile network operator, posing a significant threat across all segments.
2.  **Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) & U Mobile:** DNB operates the single wholesale 5G network. The government’s November 2024 decision to transition to a dual 5G network model, with U Mobile selected for the second network, fundamentally alters the 5G landscape, forcing Maxis to re-evaluate its infrastructure strategy.
3.  **Telekom Malaysia (TM):** A major fixed broadband provider (Unifi), directly competing with Maxis’s home and enterprise fibre expansion.
4.  **Smaller Competitors:** Engage in aggressive pricing, impacting market stability.

### Market Structure and Maxis's Response

The **dual 5G network model**, formalized by a Ministerial Direction on 31 December 2024, is the most impactful structural change, introducing strategic uncertainty for Maxis’s long-term 5G infrastructure future. Maxis's Capex declined in FY2024 (RM675m vs FY2023: RM813m, FY2022: RM755m), raising questions about its readiness for substantial new 5G investments if it opts to build a second network. Maxis acknowledges **intensified competition** from mergers like CelcomDigi. In response, Maxis prioritizes **customer experience** (NPS +70), **converged solutions**, and **digitalization/AI adoption**.

### Market Share Trends and Strategies

Maxis claims to be "Malaysia's leading integrated telco" and asserts "market share growth at twice the industry rate" in mobile. However, **lack of comparative market share data makes these claims unsubstantiated.**

| Metric                      | FY2024      | 1Q25        | Trend    |
|:----------------------------|:------------|:------------|:---------|
| Total Consumer Subs ('000)  | 10,488      | 10,560      | Growing  |
| Postpaid Subs ('000)        | 3,882       | 3,982       | Growing  |
| Postpaid ARPU (RM)          | N/A         | 71.8        | Declining|
| Prepaid ARPU (RM)           | N/A         | 34.3        | Declining|
| 5G Device Subs (mil)        | 3.7         | N/A         | Growing  |

**Insights:** Total consumer subscriptions grew 3.7% YoY to 10.56 million (1Q25), driven by postpaid (9.1% YoY). Home connections grew 4.5% YoY to 784,000 (FY2024), and 5G device subscriptions grew 50% to 3.7 million (FY2024), indicating successful proposition adoption. However, **persistent ARPU decline** (e.g., Postpaid ARPU down 4.4% YoY to RM71.8 in 1Q25) **signals intense pricing competition**, forcing Maxis to maintain volume at the expense of per-user value, placing pressure on cost discipline.

Maxis's strategies include leveraging customer experience (NPS +70), bundling converged solutions, driving digitalization and AI, maintaining operational excellence, and fostering strategic partnerships.

### Current Positioning and Critical Outlook

Maxis is positioned as a leading integrated provider, supported by extensive 96% 4G coverage and comprehensive converged services. The **dual 5G network model is the most critical recent development**, introducing significant uncertainty to Maxis's long-term 5G strategy and potential infrastructure investment. While Maxis presents a positive outlook, the **persistent ARPU decline and the lack of externally verifiable market share data** against key competitors remain critical unquantified risks for its long-term revenue quality and competitive standing in a rapidly evolving market.
