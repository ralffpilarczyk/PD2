    *Sources: FY2024 Annual Report, p.8, p.9; FY2024 Q4 Unaudited Financial Statements, p.4, p.14; 1H2024 Results Briefing Presentation, p.5.*

*   **Benchmarking:** The provided documents do not include specific revenue or market share data for key competitors or industry averages, precluding a direct quantitative comparison.

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** Manufacturing revenue for continuing operations grew by 10.5% in FY2024 to S$114.9 million, driven by a 4.2% increase in 1H2024 and a stronger 17.2% increase in 2H2024 (FY2024 Q4 Unaudited Financial Statements, p.4). This growth was primarily due to "higher order volumes from existing customers" and "new projects secured in the biomedical and consumer segments" (FY2024 Annual Report, p.5). Geographically, Singapore and Malaysia operations saw significant sales improvements of 20.9% and 24.9% respectively in FY2024 (FY2024 Annual Report, p.9), reflecting successful diversification and stronger demand in these regions. Conversely, China operations experienced an 11.8% decline in revenue in FY2024, attributed to a "slower-than-expected recovery in the domestic economy" (FY2024 Annual Report, p.9). The Company's strategic transformation, including advanced tooling capabilities and the introduction of a New Product Introduction (NPI) team, enabled these project wins in higher-margin product categories (FY2024 Annual Report, p.5).

*   **Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** The Company's strategy to focus on high-precision manufacturing, especially in the biomedical and consumer segments, is likely sustainable due to the "relatively 'sticky' nature of projects involving high-precision tooling" (FY2024 Annual Report, p.6). The "order book at the end of FY2024 has increased 20% year-on-year" (FY2024 Annual Report, p.6), indicating continued momentum into FY2025. Furthermore, geopolitical uncertainties are driving customers to seek production outside China, positioning Fu Yu's Singapore and Malaysia facilities favorably (FY2024 Annual Report, p.6). However, a sustained slowdown in China or intense competition in the growing Singapore/Malaysia segments could pose risks.

*   **Quantify Financial Impact:** The 10.5% growth in manufacturing revenue for FY2024 directly contributed to the Group's overall revenue increase of 0.5% (S$191.3 million from S$190.4 million), significantly offsetting the S$10 million decline from the discontinued supply chain segment (FY2024 Annual Report, p.8). This manufacturing growth was instrumental in narrowing the Group's net loss from S$10.1 million in FY2023 to S$3.9 million in FY2024 (FY2024 Annual Report, p.8).

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    *   To what extent does the recent increase in order volumes reflect new customers versus increased orders from existing customers, and what is the typical contract duration and renewal rate for high-precision manufacturing projects, particularly in the biomedical segment? (Ref: FY2024 Annual Report, p.5)
    *   Given the decline in China operations revenue, what specific market or competitive conditions led to this underperformance, and what is the long-term strategy for regaining or stabilizing market share in this region, beyond a "China-for-China" focus? (Ref: FY2024 Annual Report, p.9; 1H2024 Results Briefing Presentation, p.13)

#### 2. Manufacturing Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

*   **Definition and Relevance:** This metric measures the gross profit generated from the manufacturing segment as a percentage of its revenue. It is a direct indicator of the Company's unit economics, reflecting its pricing power, efficiency in managing direct production costs (materials, labor, manufacturing overheads), and ability to absorb fixed costs per unit of output. A higher GPM indicates healthier unit economics and better operational profitability.

*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - derived semi-annually):**

    | Metric                         | 1H2023 | 2H23   | FY2023 | 1H2024 | 2H24   | FY2024 |
    | :----------------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
    | **Manufacturing GPM (%)**      | 11.85% | 11.57% | 11.7%  | 12.86% | 14.10% | 13.5%  |
    | **Change (ppt vs. prior H/FY)** |        |        |        | +1.01  | +2.53  | +1.8   |

    *Sources: FY2024 Annual Report, p.8; FY2024 Q4 Unaudited Financial Statements, p.4; 1H2024 Results Briefing Presentation, p.5, p.6. (Semi-annual GPMs derived from revenue and gross profit figures).*

*   **Benchmarking:** No direct GPM data for competitors or industry averages is available in the provided documents for a comparative benchmark.

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** The manufacturing GPM improved significantly from 11.7% in FY2023 to 13.5% in FY2024 (FY2024 Annual Report, p.8). This positive trend accelerated in the second half of FY2024, reaching 14.10% (derived from FY2024 Q4 Unaudited Financial Statements, p.4). Drivers include the success of the "strategic transformation" focusing on "high-precision manufacturing" and new projects in "higher-margin product categories" such as medical devices, drone technology, and smart appliances (FY2024 Annual Report, p.5). The "introduction of our New Product Introduction ("NPI") team" and "advanced tooling with high precision" (FY2024 Annual Report, p.5) allowed the Company to move up the value chain, commanding potentially better unit pricing. Furthermore, "lower expenses relating to employee costs, travelling expenses, water and electricity charges and sundry expenses" contributed to overall cost reduction (FY2024 Annual Report, p.8), thereby supporting margin expansion.

*   **Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** The GPM improvement is likely sustainable as it is linked to a strategic shift towards higher-value, high-precision products with "sticky" customer relationships (FY2024 Annual Report, p.6). The Company's continued investment in the Smart Factory, Industry 4.0 machinery, and enhanced automation (FY2024 Annual Report, p.6) also supports future efficiency gains and margin potential. However, external factors such as higher raw material costs (Risk Management Report, p.99) or geopolitical tensions (1H2024 Results Briefing Presentation, p.13) could pose headwinds.

*   **Quantify Financial Impact:** The 1.8 percentage point increase in manufacturing GPM in FY2024 contributed an additional S$2.7 million in gross profit (1.8% of S$114.9M manufacturing revenue) compared to maintaining FY2023 margins. This margin expansion significantly contributed to the 27.5% increase in gross profit for the manufacturing segment and was a key factor in narrowing the Group's overall net loss.

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    *   Can management provide a breakdown of gross profit margins by key product categories (e.g., biomedical, consumer, automotive, industrial) and highlight which categories drove the most significant margin expansion in FY2024? (Ref: FY2024 Annual Report, p.5)
    *   What specific cost-containment measures, particularly regarding employee, utility, and sundry expenses, are considered sustainable, and what is the potential impact of rising raw material costs (e.g., specific plastic resins) on future GPM? (Ref: FY2024 Annual Report, p.8; Risk Management Report, p.99)

#### 3. Energy Intensity (Manufacturing Segment)

*   **Definition and Relevance:** This metric quantifies the total energy consumed (in Gigajoules, GJ) per S$ million of revenue generated specifically by the manufacturing segment. It is a critical indicator of operational efficiency and asset utilization, demonstrating how effectively Fu Yu converts energy inputs into economic output. Improved (lower) energy intensity suggests more efficient resource management, reduced operational costs, and a smaller environmental footprint, directly impacting the Company's unit economics and sustainability profile.

*   **Historical Data (Last 24 Months - Annually):**

    | Metric                                | FY2023    | FY2024    | Change (YoY%) |
    | :------------------------------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ |
    | **Total Energy Consumed (GJ)**        | 118,698.7 | 119,942.0 | +1.1%         |
    | **Manufacturing Revenue (S$M)**       | 103.9     | 114.9     | +10.5%        |
    | **Energy Intensity (GJ/S$M Revenue)** | 1,142.4   | 1,044.0   | -8.6%         |

    *Sources: FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.38 (Energy Consumption table, Energy Intensity table); FY2024 Annual Report, p.8.*

    *Note: Total Energy Consumed is sum of Petrol, Diesel, Electricity, and Solar where applicable. FY2023 Energy Intensity derived from reported energy consumption and manufacturing revenue. FY2024 Energy Intensity as reported.*

*   **Benchmarking:** No industry-specific energy intensity benchmarks for precision plastic and metal component manufacturing are provided in the documents, limiting direct comparison.

*   **Analysis of Drivers:** Despite a slight absolute increase in total energy consumed by 1.1% in FY2024 due to increased production activities (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.38), Fu Yu significantly improved its energy intensity by 8.6%, from 1,142.4 GJ/S$M in FY2023 to 1,044.0 GJ/S$M in FY2024. This improvement indicates that the Company generated more revenue for each unit of energy consumed. Key drivers include investments in "energy-efficient electric machines to replace older hydraulic machines," "upgrade existing lighting with more efficient LED lighting," and "solar panel installation in our production facilities" (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.38). The solar panels in Singapore were completed in FY2024, with Malaysia facilities coming online in FY2025 (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.47). Other initiatives like optimizing production planning and regular maintenance also contributed (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.38). Similarly, GHG Emissions Intensity also decreased from 214.5 tCO2e/S$M in FY2023 to 191.9 tCO2e/S$M in FY2024 (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.39), reflecting overall efficiency gains and a commitment to sustainability.

*   **Sustainability of Current Performance Trend:** The trend of improving energy intensity appears sustainable, underpinned by ongoing investments in the Smart Factory's Industry 4.0 machinery and a commitment to integrating renewable energy (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.47; Risk Management Report, p.99). The Company's strategic shift to electric machinery and 3D printing further supports long-term efficiency gains (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.47). The completion of solar panel installations in Malaysia by 2Q2025 (FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.47) will further enhance this trend.

*   **Quantify Financial Impact:** The 8.6% improvement in energy intensity, coupled with overall cost-containment measures, contributes to lower utility expenses per unit of revenue, thereby supporting the expansion of the manufacturing gross profit margin (FY2024 Annual Report, p.8). While specific cost savings from energy efficiency are not isolated, they are embedded within the broader reduction in "water and electricity charges" that contributed to the 20.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses (FY2024 Annual Report, p.8), and ultimately to the improved profitability of the manufacturing segment.

*   **Due Diligence Questions:**
    *   What is the specific capital expenditure allocated to energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives for FY2025, and what are the projected cost savings and ROI from these investments? (Ref: FY2024 Annual Report, p.8; FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.38)
    *   How does the Company's energy consumption (absolute and intensity) vary with production volume fluctuations, and what measures are in place to maintain efficiency during periods of lower utilization? (Ref: FY2024 Sustainability Report, p.38)
