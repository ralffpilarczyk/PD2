## SECTION 3: Key Customers

Maxis Berhad, as a leading integrated telecommunications provider in Malaysia, serves a diverse customer base segmented primarily into Consumer and Enterprise divisions. The company's customer strategy revolves around enhancing connectivity, delivering innovative solutions, and improving customer experience across these segments.

### a. List of Largest Customers

Maxis does not explicitly name individual "largest customers" in its public disclosures, which is common for telecommunications companies due to the vast number of subscribers. Instead, it segments its customer base into broad categories:

*   **Consumer Segment:** This represents the largest portion of Maxis's customer base, encompassing individual mobile subscribers (postpaid and prepaid) and home connectivity users (fibre and wireless broadband).
    *   Mobile Revenue Generating Subscribers (RGS): 10.4 million as of FY2024, growing to 10.56 million as of Q1 2025.
    *   Home Connections: 787,000 as of Q1 2025.
*   **Enterprise Segment:** This segment serves businesses across various sizes, from corporates and mid-market to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the public sector. While specific names are not disclosed, the company highlights partnerships and initiatives with:
    *   Global cloud providers (e.g., AWS, as an Advanced Tier Services Partner and Direct Connect Partner).
    *   Investment banks (e.g., managed SD-WAN network for a top-tier investment bank in Q1 2025).
    *   Various industry players through the Maxis 5G Alliance (75 members by end of FY2024).
    *   SMEs through government initiatives (e.g., Geran Digital PMKS Madani, UsahaWIRA community, supporting 20,000 SMEs by FY2024).
*   **Wholesale Customers/Partners:** This includes other mobile network operators (MNOs) to whom Maxis provides 2G and 4G wholesale services. Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) is a significant wholesale network provider *to* Maxis for 5G services, making Maxis a customer of DNB, but also a potential future partner in a dual 5G network model.
*   **Related Parties as Customers/Partners:** Maxis has significant transactions with related parties that also function as customers or suppliers. These include:
    *   MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems Sdn. Bhd. (Astro): For co-marketing and/or distribution of Astro content with Maxis' fibre service.
    *   Saudi Telecom Company (STC) / Kuwait Telecommunications Company (stc): For roaming and international calls.
    *   Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB): For 5G products and services (Maxis is a customer here, but also a shareholder and potential future network operator).

### b. Position in the Value Chain

Maxis primarily operates as a **Tier 1 service provider** directly to end-consumers (B2C) and businesses (B2B).

*   **B2C:** Provides direct mobile, home internet, and digital lifestyle services.
*   **B2B:** Offers a robust portfolio of enterprise products and ICT solutions, including connectivity, IoT, cloud, AI, and cybersecurity. In this context, Maxis acts as a direct supplier of integrated telecommunications and digital solutions to businesses.
*   **Wholesale:** Maxis also engages in wholesale activities, providing 2G and 4G wholesale services to other mobile network operators. This positions them as a **Tier 1 supplier** to these other MNOs.
*   **Relationship with DNB:** Maxis is currently a customer of DNB for 5G wholesale access. However, with the transition to a dual 5G network model, Maxis has the eligibility to potentially own and operate the second 5G network, which could shift its position from solely a customer to a network operator in the 5G wholesale value chain.

### c. Relationship Strength and Duration

Maxis emphasizes strong customer relationships, evidenced by:

*   **High Customer Satisfaction:** Achieved an All-time high TP-NPS (Total Net Promoter Score) of **+70** in FY2024, placing Maxis among the Top 20 Leading CX Companies in Malaysia and earning a Platinum Award for Best Contact Centre Operations in APAC. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 28)
*   **Digital Transformation for Customer Experience:** Accelerated self-serve adoption (one in four postpaid customers completed contracting/upgrading digitally in FY2024, over 80% of prepaid internet purchases via app). Utilizes AI (Dexter) in contact centers, reducing average handling times by 25 seconds. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 29)
*   **Proactive Engagement:** Introduced personalized network notifications and enhanced digital complaint management systems. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 29)
*   **Loyalty Programs:** Operates a loyalty program providing material rights for future products/services. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 127)
*   **Enterprise Focus:** Emphasizes deepening customer relationships through segment-focused strategies and customer-centric solutions. (Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 7)

### e. Customer Segmentation by Industry and Geography

*   **Industry:**
    *   **Consumer:** Individuals and households.
    *   **Enterprise:** Corporates, mid-market businesses, SMEs, public sector, and other mobile network operators (for wholesale services). Maxis actively supports SME digitalization across various industries.
*   **Geography:**
    *   Predominantly **Malaysia**. All operations of the Group are based in Malaysia. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 132)
    *   **Other countries:** Generates revenue from roaming business (RM220 million in FY2024). (Maxis 24 AR, p. 133)

### f. Customer Positioning (Premium, Mid-market, Value Segments)

Maxis employs a strategic dual-brand approach to cater to different customer segments:

*   **Premium:** Targeted by **Maxis Postpaid** plans, designed for working professionals, families, and high-value users, offering unlimited 5G data and enhanced features. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 30)
*   **Mid-market:** Maxis also offers plans and device programs that appeal to mid-market consumers seeking a balance of features and value.
*   **Value Segments:** Targeted by **Hotlink** brand (both postpaid and prepaid), offering affordable, data-rich plans for budget-conscious users, students, and young professionals. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 30)
*   **Enterprise:** Solutions are tailored to meet the specific needs of various enterprise sizes (SME, mid-market, corporate), implying a tiered approach to service and pricing.

### g. Revenue Contribution and Customer Concentration

Maxis's revenue is primarily driven by its Consumer and Enterprise segments.

**Revenue Contribution by Segment (RM million)**

| Segment                 | FY2022 (AR) | FY2023 (AR) | FY2024 (AR) | 1Q24 (Pres) | 2Q24 (Pres) | 3Q24 (Pres) | 4Q24 (Pres) | 1Q25 (Pres) |
|:------------------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|
| **Total Revenue**       | 9,789       | 10,180      | 10,536      | 2,603       | 2,586       | 2,576       | 2,771       | 2,608       |
| **Service Revenue**     | 8,336       | 8,572       | 8,868       | 2,191       | 2,216       | 2,213       | 2,248       | 2,171       |
| Consumer Business       | 6,948       | 7,064       | 7,258       | 1,804       | 1,815       | 1,817       | 1,822       | 1,773       |
| Enterprise Business     | 1,388       | 1,508       | 1,610       | 387         | 401         | 396         | 426         | 398         |
| Non-Service Revenue     | 1,453       | 1,608       | 1,668       | 412         | 370         | 363         | 523         | 437         |

*Source: Maxis 24 AR, p. 10, 8; Maxis 24Q4 FS, p. 15; Maxis 25Q1 FS, p. 16; Maxis 25Q1 Pres, Appendix 'Revenue Composition'.*

**Customer Concentration:**
Maxis does not appear to have significant customer concentration risk with any single named customer, as its revenue is diversified across a large consumer base and a broad range of enterprise clients. The largest revenue contributions come from the aggregated Consumer and Enterprise segments.

*   **Consumer Dominance:** The Consumer segment consistently contributes the majority of service revenue (e.g., RM7.26 billion out of RM8.87 billion service revenue in FY2024, approximately 81.8%).
*   **Enterprise Growth:** The Enterprise segment shows robust growth (+6.8% in FY2024), indicating its increasing importance, although it remains smaller than the Consumer segment.
*   **Related Party Transactions:** While Maxis has material contracts with related parties (e.g., MEASAT, Astro, STC), the disclosed transaction values (e.g., RM90 million sales to MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems in FY2024) are relatively small compared to Maxis's total revenue (RM10.54 billion in FY2024), suggesting no undue concentration with these specific entities. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 199)

**Critical Stance:** Management's commentary in Q4 2024 stated "total subscribers by 2.4% year-on-year to 9.7 billion subscribers" (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 6). This is an obvious anomaly, as the FS and other reports clearly show total RGS in the millions (e.g., 10.4 million in AR 2024, p. 28). This is likely a typo in the transcript, but highlights the need for data verification. The official figure for FY2024 is **10.488 million** (Maxis 25Q1 Pres, Appendix 'RGS30 and ARPU').

### h. Purchase Patterns and Contract Terms

*   **Mobile:**
    *   **Postpaid Growth:** Maxis actively encourages prepaid customers to transition to postpaid plans, recognizing postpaid as a more stable revenue stream. This strategy has led to significant postpaid subscriber growth (+7.9% YoY in FY2024). (Maxis 24 AR, p. 8)
    *   **Device Bundling:** Attractive bundling offers and flexible ownership programs (Maxis Zerolution, Trade-In Programme) drive device sales and customer stickiness. Device payments can be spread over periods of up to 36 months. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 30, 126)
    *   **Prepaid Decline/Stabilization:** Prepaid revenue declined in FY2024, and the subscriber base saw a marginal decrease. Maxis aims to encourage migration to postpaid. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 8)
*   **Home Connectivity:**
    *   **Fibre Expansion:** Focus on expanding fibre network and enhancing home connectivity solutions, reflecting increasing demand for reliable, high-speed internet. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 8)
    *   **Bundled Propositions:** Emphasis on elevating bundled propositions (e.g., Maxis Home Solar, smart home devices integration) to enhance customer experience and loyalty. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 12, 31; Maxis 25Q1 Pres, p. 2)
*   **Enterprise:**
    *   **Diversified Offerings:** Shift towards diversifying service offerings beyond traditional mobile to cater to specific enterprise needs, including fixed and digital solutions. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 8)
    *   **Project-Based Revenue:** Enterprise fixed & solutions revenue can be significantly influenced by non-recurring charges from project completions, leading to quarterly fluctuations. (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 8; Maxis 25Q1 TS, slide 8)
    *   **Long-Term Contracts:** Enterprise solutions often involve longer-term contracts (e.g., SD-WAN deployments).
*   **Wholesale (DNB):** Maxis's agreement with DNB involves a conditional share subscription and a prepayment for 5G products and services, signaling long-term engagement in the 5G wholesale market. The terms include options for equity restructuring related to the dual 5G network model. (Maxis 24 AR, p. 149-150)

**Critical Stance:** The "new commercial arrangement for SafeDevice program" impacted service revenue recognition in Q1 2025 (Maxis 25Q1 TS, slide 4). This highlights how changes in revenue recognition principles, even without affecting EBITDA, can obscure underlying performance trends in reported service revenue. The repeated emphasis on "non-recurring service revenue" in Enterprise (Maxis 24Q4 TS, slide 8; Maxis 25Q1 TS, slide 8) suggests that while overall enterprise revenue is growing, a portion of this growth might not be sustainable or predictable without a continuous pipeline of large projects. This warrants closer monitoring to assess the true underlying growth of recurring enterprise services.
