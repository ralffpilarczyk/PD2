### Executive Summary: Critical Insights & Key Concerns

Fu Yu Corporation Limited's FY2024 performance reveals a company grappling with significant internal control deficiencies and the severe repercussions of a problematic Supply Chain Management (SCM) segment. While the manufacturing operations show some signs of recovery, the overall financial health is overshadowed by substantial losses, asset impairments, and a looming external investigation.

**Key Concerns & Red Flags:**

1.  **SCM Segment Collapse & Governance Failures:** The most pressing issue is the catastrophic decline and ultimate cessation of the SCM segment (Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd. - FYSCS). This segment's revenue plummeted by 93% in 2H24 compared to 2H23, driving substantial losses and necessitating a full impairment of S$3.29 million in goodwill. The ongoing investigation (3.32) explicitly points to "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," "irregular expense claims," and critically, the Board's admission of "inadequate internal controls" within this segment. This indicates **profound governance failures and a high risk of financial irregularities and reputational damage.** The recent arbitration loss of S$1.67 million (3.33) directly stemming from FYSCS further underscores the liabilities arising from this segment.

2.  **Financial Instability Despite Manufacturing Gains:** While revenue from *continuing operations* (manufacturing) increased by 10.5%, the Group still reported a net loss of S$3.9 million for FY2024. The reduction in net loss from S$(10.1) million in FY2023 is primarily attributable to containing the escalating losses from the now-discontinued SCM segment, rather than a robust return to profitability in core operations. Significant impairments on intercompany receivables (S$3.94 million in FY2024, total allowance S$11.87 million) (3.9) also signal underlying financial vulnerabilities tied to subsidiary performance, likely exacerbated by the SCM issues. The company appears to be in a crucial cleanup phase, with the path to sustained profitability remaining uncertain.

3.  **Questionable Sustainability Reporting Credibility:** Discrepancies and omissions within the sustainability data raise concerns about the accuracy and transparency of ESG disclosures. Notably, the Board Composition by Age (1.10) contains a factual error, stating "100% 30-50 yrs old" when public records indicate several directors are over 50. Furthermore, the problematic FYSCS entity is explicitly excluded from 'Protecting the Environment' reporting (1.19), which, given the severe operational and financial issues, suggests a selective approach to disclosure.

4.  **Talent Exodus & Leadership Stability:** The timing of the departures of a key management personnel (Seow E-lin, Elaine, GCEO's family member) and the substantial shareholder Lim Wei De, Victor (5.8, 5.9), shortly after FY2024 and concurrent with the FYSCS investigation, raises questions about potential internal fallout and leadership stability. While reasons are not disclosed, the optics are concerning amidst the ongoing probe.

5.  **Operational Efficiencies & Workforce Development:** A consistent decline in average training hours per employee (1.13) falling short of future targets, coupled with historically high (and confusingly reported) employee turnover rates (1.9) in prior years, points to potential weaknesses in human capital development and retention strategies.

**In summary, Fu Yu presents a high-risk investment profile. The company's immediate future is heavily dependent on the transparent and effective resolution of the FYSCS investigation and its financial ramifications, alongside a proven ability to stabilize and grow its core manufacturing business.**

*   **Insight:** The widespread ISO certifications across the Group's manufacturing entities indicate a commitment to quality management (ISO 9001), medical devices (ISO 13485), environmental management (ISO 14001), and automotive quality (IATF 16949). This is a foundational strength for their manufacturing segment, especially as they pivot away from the problematic SCM business.

#### 1.2 Sustainability Performance Highlights
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 21*

*   **Electricity Consumed:** 113,623.0 GJ (2.5% decrease vs. FY2023)
*   **Water Consumed:** 89.1 MegaLiter (9.1% decrease vs. FY2023)
*   **Hazardous Waste Produced:** 25.7% reduction
*   **Forced Labour or Child Labour:** Zero incidents
*   **Workplace Fatalities:** Zero incidents
*   **Male and Female Employees:** Nearly 1:1 ratio
*   **Confirmed Incidents of Corruption:** Zero incidents
*   **Non-compliance with Environmental Laws (significant fines/sanctions):** Zero incidents
*   **Non-compliance with Data Protection Laws:** Zero incidents

*   **Insight:** The reported decreases in electricity and water consumption, along with a significant reduction in hazardous waste, suggest positive strides in environmental efficiency. Zero incidents of forced labor, fatalities, corruption, and non-compliance with key laws are positive indicators on paper. However, the "Zero incidents of corruption" claim must be viewed with skepticism given the ongoing FYSCS investigation (3.32) which highlights "unverifiable arrangements" and "irregular expense claims," suggesting potential misconduct that may not yet be "confirmed incidents" in a legal sense. The 1:1 male/female employee ratio is commendable, but as seen in 1.11, this balance does not extend to higher management levels.

#### 1.3 Economic Value Generated and Distributed (S$ million)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 28*

| Metric                                | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 |

| - Community investments/donations     | –      | –      | –      |
| Economic value retained               | 9.6    | (3.3)  | 8.0    |
| Net Profit/(Loss)                     | 14.6   | (10.1) | (4.5)  |

*   **Insight:** While total revenue (S$191.3 million) shows a slight increase from FY2023, the net loss persists at S$(4.5) million. This section's "Net Profit/(Loss)" figure of S$(4.5) million differs from the consolidated net loss of S$(3.9) million (2.1), implying different scopes (this table likely includes some adjustments for economic value vs. accounting profit). The shift from a retained economic value deficit in FY2023 to a positive S$8.0 million in FY2024 is encouraging but needs to be viewed in light of the overall financial losses. The significant reduction in "Payments to providers of capital" from S$12.8 million to S$0.3 million highlights reduced borrowing costs and likely debt repayment.

#### 1.4 Energy Consumption (GJ)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 38*

| Energy Consumption (GJ) | FY2022 (Restated) | FY2023 (Restated) | FY2024    |
| :---------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :-------- |
| Petrol                  | 528.7             | 575.6             | 588.7     |

| Year   | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) | Revenue (S$'mil) | Energy Intensity (GJ/S$'mil Revenue) |
| :----- | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| FY2024 | 119,942.0                  | 114.9            | 1,044.0                              |

*   **Insight:** While overall electricity consumption decreased, total energy consumed (119,942.0 GJ) saw a slight increase from the sum of FY2023 components (116,481.6 + 575.6 + 1,641.5 = 118,698.7 GJ) due to the introduction of solar energy usage. The company also began selling solar energy and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in FY2024, indicating a step towards renewable energy adoption and monetization. However, the reported energy intensity (1,044.0 GJ/S$'mil Revenue) is based on S$114.9 million revenue (likely continuing operations only, see 2.1), which significantly inflates the intensity figure compared to using the total revenue of S$191.3 million (3.18). This discrepancy in revenue used for intensity calculation obscures a true picture of energy efficiency per dollar of overall business activity.

| GHG Emissions Intensity  | tCO2e/ S$'mil  | 170.2    | 214.4    | 191.9    |
| **GHG Scope-wise Intensity** |                |          |          |          |
| Scope 1                  | tCO2e/ S$'mil  | 1.2      | 1.5      | 1.6      |
| Scope 2                  | tCO2e/ S$'mil  | 169.0    | 212.9    | 190.3    |

*   **FY2024 Short-term Target (Scope 2):** Reduce by 3.0% using FY2023 as baseline.
*   **Actual FY2024 Reduction (Scope 2):** 1.4%
*   **Medium-term Target (Scope 2):** Reduce by 30% by FY2030, using FY2023 as baseline.

*   **Insight:** Total GHG emissions (tCO2e) continued to decrease, showing a positive trend. However, the company fell short of its FY2024 short-term target for Scope 2 emissions reduction (1.4% actual vs. 3.0% target). This indicates that while progress is being made, the pace may not be sufficient to meet more ambitious medium-term targets like the 30% reduction by FY2030. Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased electricity) overwhelmingly dominate the company's carbon footprint (over 99%), making energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption critical for future reductions. The GHG intensity calculation, similar to energy intensity, likely suffers from the same revenue discrepancy (see 1.4 insight) and may not accurately reflect true intensity per dollar of full business activity.

#### 1.6 Water Consumption (MegaLiter)

*   **Insight:** The historical hiring and turnover rates for FY2022 and FY2023 (both over 50%) are **exceptionally high** and indicative of significant workforce instability. Even the FY2024 rates, while lower (26.7% hiring, 24.9% turnover), still suggest a dynamic workforce where a quarter of employees are new or leaving annually.
    *   **"Rate (%)" Clarification:** It's important to clarify how these "Rate (%)" figures are calculated. Given that the sum of regional/gender/age group percentages often exceeds or significantly differs from the "Total Rate (%)", it appears the "Rate (%)" for specific groups (e.g., Male Rate %) might be calculated as a percentage of the *total company headcount* rather than as a percentage of the *gender/age group's headcount*. This unusual reporting methodology makes the figures difficult to interpret and compare with industry standards. For example, if "Male Rate (%)" means male new hires as a percentage of total company headcount, it’s not a true "hiring rate" for that demographic. The high churn, particularly in prior years, warrants a deeper investigation into underlying causes such as management practices, compensation, or job satisfaction, as it can significantly impact productivity, institutional knowledge, and operational costs.

#### 1.10 Board Composition by Gender & Age Group (FY2024)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 55*

| Composition of Board of Directors, by Gender | FY2024 |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| Male                                         | 100%   |
| Female                                       | 0%     |

| Composition of Board of Directors, by Age Group | FY2024 |

| 30 - 50 yrs old                                 | 100%   |
| Over 50 yrs old                                 | 0%     |

*   **Insight:** The board composition shows a complete lack of gender diversity (100% Male, 0% Female). More critically, the "100% 30-50 yrs old" for age composition is a **factual error** based on the Annual Report's own disclosures. The Board (as listed in 5.2) includes Christopher Huang, Daniel Poh, and Royston Tan, all of whom are publicly stated or generally understood to be over 50 years old. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the entire sustainability reporting section and raises concerns about data validation processes. A lack of diversity on the board, both in gender and potentially in age (if the reported data were accurate, it would imply a very young board for a public company), can lead to groupthink and limit the range of perspectives needed for effective oversight and strategic decision-making, particularly concerning complex issues like the recent SCM investigation.

#### 1.11 Percentage of Employees per Employee Category, by Gender – FY2024
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 55*

| Percentage of Employees per Employee Category, by Gender – FY2024 | Male  | Female |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- | :----- |
| Senior management                                                 | 80.0% | 20.0%  |

| Executive level                                                   | 52.1% | 47.9%  |
| Workers                                                           | 46.3% | 53.7%  |
| **Total**                                                         | **50.0%** | **50.0%** |

*   **Insight:** While the overall employee gender ratio is 1:1, there is a clear "pipeline problem" or "glass ceiling" for female employees. The representation of females significantly decreases at higher levels of management, from 53.7% at the worker level to only 20.0% at senior management. This indicates a lack of gender diversity at the strategic decision-making echelons, which can hinder inclusive perspectives and potentially impact talent attraction and retention for female employees. This compounds the issue of 100% male board composition (1.10).

| **Total**                                                            | **17.4%**          | **61.4%**       | **21.2%**         |

*   **Insight:** The majority of the workforce falls within the 30-50 years old bracket, which is typical for an industrial company. However, the senior management is predominantly comprised of individuals over 50 years old (55%), with no one under 30 in senior management. This indicates an experienced, but potentially less agile, leadership team, which could impact innovation and adaptation to rapidly changing market conditions or emerging technologies.

#### 1.13 Average Training Hours Per Employee

| **Total**         | **17.0** | **16.0** | **13.2** |

*   **FY2025 Target:** 15 hours per employee.

*   **Insight:** The overall average training hours per employee have consistently decreased from 17.0 in FY2022 to 13.2 in FY2024, falling short of the FY2025 target of 15 hours. This decline, particularly noticeable for male employees and executive-level staff, is a concern for workforce development and skill enhancement. Reduced training could potentially impact productivity, adaptability, and employee morale, especially in a dynamic manufacturing environment.

| Employee Category | Male  | Female | Total |
| :---------------- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| Senior management | 100%  | 100%   | 100%  |
| Middle management | 100%  | 100%   | 100%  |

| Workers           | 98%   | 91%    | 94%   |

*   **Insight:** The high percentage of employees receiving performance and career development reviews (generally above 90%) indicates a strong commitment to performance management and feedback. This is a positive aspect for employee engagement and development, though the slightly lower rates for male executive level and female workers could be areas for targeted improvement.

*   **Insight:** Zero fatalities and high-consequence injuries over three years is excellent. While the number of recordable work-related injuries slightly increased in FY2024, the rate (4.6) is still within a manageable range, and the number of lost days significantly decreased to 76. This suggests effective health and safety protocols, even as total man-hours decreased, possibly due to the reduction in headcount (1.8).

#### 1.16 Compliance with Laws and Regulations
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 62*

*   **FY2024:** Zero instances for which significant fines were incurred, and zero instances for which non-monetary sanctions were incurred.
*   **FY2023:** Fines for non-compliance amounted to RMB 20,000.

*   **Insight:** Reporting zero significant fines or non-monetary sanctions in FY2024 is positive for compliance. However, this statement must be critically evaluated in the context of the FYSCS investigation (3.32) and the arbitration loss (3.33). While these issues may not have triggered "fines or non-monetary sanctions" in FY2024, they certainly point to significant non-compliance with internal policies and potentially legal obligations, carrying substantial financial and reputational penalties.

*   **Confirmed incidents of corruption during the year:** Zero.

*   **Insight:** The company reports 100% assessment of operations for corruption risks and 100% communication and training coverage for both governance body members and all employee categories. This suggests a robust framework for anti-corruption measures. However, the claim of "Zero confirmed incidents of corruption" for FY2024 again faces strong skepticism given the ongoing and highly publicized FYSCS investigation (3.32). The findings of "unverifiable arrangements" and "irregular expense claims" within a key segment fundamentally challenge the effectiveness of these reported anti-corruption measures and imply a significant failure in preventing or detecting corrupt practices within the year. The definition of "confirmed" may be too narrow given the circumstances.

*   **Insight:** It is notable that Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd (FYSCS), the entity at the center of the ongoing investigation and significant financial losses, is **explicitly marked "N" for 'Protecting the Environment'** in its sustainability reporting scope. This selective exclusion, combined with the factual error in Board age reporting (1.10) and the "zero corruption" claim amidst the investigation (1.17), raises significant concerns about the completeness and reliability of Fu Yu's sustainability disclosures. It suggests a potential attempt to de-emphasize negative environmental impacts or governance issues of a problematic subsidiary within the broader sustainability narrative.

| Gearing              | Net Cash | Net Cash |
| Return on Equity     | (3.3 %)  | (7.4%)   |

*   **Insight:** The Group reported a net loss of S$(3.9) million in FY2024, an improvement from S$(10.1) million in FY2023. This "improvement" is primarily driven by a significant reduction in losses from *continuing operations* (from S$(7.6) million to S$(1.2) million). However, the *loss from discontinued operations* (SCM segment) worsened by 32.0%, increasing from S$(2.5) million to S$(3.3) million, despite its effective cessation of significant revenue-generating activities (see 3.26 and 4.1). This indicates that the Group's financial recovery is heavily influenced by the winding down and containment of losses from the problematic SCM segment, rather than a robust performance from its core manufacturing business alone. While Gross Profit Margin for continuing operations improved, the overall picture remains one of financial cleanup and stabilization rather than strong growth.

    The balance sheet shows a slight decrease in total assets and shareholders' equity. The company remains in a net cash position, which provides some liquidity, but cash and bank balances have decreased. The negative Return on Equity (ROE) of (3.3%) indicates continued unprofitability, although it has improved from FY2023's (7.4%).

    **Note on Revenue Discrepancy:** The "Revenue (Continuing Operations)" of S$114.9 million presented here (from the AR Highlights) refers specifically to the Manufacturing segment. The "Total Revenue" figures of S$191.3 million (3.18) and S$191.283 million (1.3) include both continuing (Manufacturing) and discontinued (SCM) operations, offering a more complete picture of the company's overall top-line activity before the SCM segment's collapse was fully reflected.

*   **Insight:** The Group's goodwill was fully impaired in FY2024, reflecting the cessation of operations in the Supply Chain Management Services segment (3.7). This is a critical adjustment, signifying the recognition of a non-recoverable asset due to operational failure. The decrease in deferred tax assets (from S$1.26 million to S$0.81 million) for the Group, coupled with an increase in unutilised tax losses not recognized (3.10), suggests a continued challenging tax environment and potential for future profitability issues. While current assets slightly increased, the significant drop in cash (S$60.3 million to S$55.5 million) is notable. The company has reduced its current portion of loans and borrowings substantially, indicative of successful debt management or repayment, primarily the full repayment of bank loans (3.12).

*   **Insight:** Revenue from continuing operations (Manufacturing) grew by 10.5% in FY2024, indicating a positive trend for the core business. This led to a significant improvement in profit/loss before income tax for continuing operations, moving from a substantial loss of S$(8.1) million to a marginal profit of S$0.15 million. This turnaround in the core business is critical.
    However, the **Loss from discontinued operations increased by 6.3%** to S$(2.67) million in FY2024. This segment (FYSCS) continues to be a drain on overall profitability, contributing significantly to the total net loss, despite its operational wind-down. The magnitude of this loss, even after the cessation of operations, points to residual costs and liabilities (including impairment of goodwill, see 3.7, and the Evertree claim, see 3.33) stemming from the issues uncovered by the ongoing investigation (3.32). The tax expense shifted from a credit to a significant expense in FY2024, further impacting the bottom line. The positive foreign currency translation differences in FY2024 are a benefit to comprehensive income but are non-operational.

*   **Insight:** The Group's retained earnings continue to decrease due to ongoing losses, falling from S$61.5 million to S$57.6 million. The impact of foreign currency translation differences turning positive in FY2024 mitigated the total comprehensive loss, but the underlying operational losses remain a primary concern. The transfer upon liquidation of a subsidiary in FY2023 (S$4.442 million from statutory reserve to retained earnings) highlights ongoing corporate restructuring. The share-based payment reserve was fully utilized by FY2024, indicating the settlement of awards (3.31).

*   **Insight:** The Group significantly improved its cash flow from operations, moving from a deficit of S$(4.54) million in FY2023 to generating S$3.6 million in FY2024. This is a positive development, primarily driven by better management of working capital and reduced tax payments.
    However, the cash flow statement explicitly details the **impact of impairments**: S$3.29 million for goodwill and S$0.58 million for PPE were non-cash expenses impacting the net loss but added back in the cash flow reconciliation. These impairments highlight significant asset write-downs.
    Cash used in investing activities increased, driven by higher purchases of PPE (S$6.94 million in FY2024 vs S$3.96 million in FY2023), indicating continued investment in manufacturing capabilities, which aligns with the strategic pivot after the SCM segment's issues.
    Net cash generated from financing activities turned positive in FY2024, mainly due to the full repayment of bank loans and an increase in cash restricted in use, implying strategic liquidity management or new arrangements. Overall, while cash burn decreased significantly, the company still saw a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, indicating that it is still consuming cash despite the operational improvements.

\*Additions included right-of-use assets: FY2024: \$2,449k; FY2023: \$1,150k.
\*\*Disposals/write-off for FY2024 included a reassessment of estimated costs to complete for a leasehold property, reducing costs by \$805k.

*   **Insight:** The Group's PPE additions nearly doubled in FY2024 (S$9.39 million vs. S$4.89 million in FY2023), indicating significant capital investment in operational assets, particularly factory equipment and plant and machinery. This suggests a strategic focus on enhancing manufacturing capabilities following the pivot away from the SCM segment. However, the recognition of a S$579k impairment on PPE in FY2024 (also detailed in 3.4) indicates challenges in specific asset utilization or value, even as overall additions increase. The reassessment of costs for a leasehold property (reducing costs by S$805k) suggests active re-evaluation of asset values.

*   **Insight:** Similar to the Group, the Company also increased its PPE additions in FY2024 (S$6.06 million vs. S$3.84 million). The pattern of increased investment in core assets suggests a commitment to strengthening the company's operational base. The reassessment of leasehold property costs also impacted the Company's PPE (reducing costs by S$805k).

| **Net cash outflow for purchase of PPE**                     | **6,940** | **3,962** |

*   **Insight:** This table clarifies the cash outflow for PPE purchases, distinguishing it from total additions by accounting for non-cash elements like right-of-use assets (leases, see 3.30). The significant increase in cash outflow for PPE purchases (S$6.94 million vs S$3.96 million) reinforces the observation that the company is actively investing capital into its physical assets, likely to bolster its core manufacturing capabilities.

#### 3.4 PPE Impairment Assessment (China CGU & Singapore Tooling CGU)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Pages 116-117*

*   **China Subsidiaries (Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal - FVLCD):**
    *   FVLDC: approx. \$9,225k & \$18,897k (2023: \$7,454k & \$18,974k)
    *   Carrying Amounts: \$933k & \$1,988k (2023: \$1,055k & \$2,690k)
    *   No impairment loss required.
*   **China Subsidiary (Value in Use - VIU):**
    *   Recoverable amount: \$Nil.
    *   Key assumptions:
        *   Discount rate: 10.2% (pre-tax)
        *   Growth rates: based on 5-year forecast and terminal value growth rate of 2%.
    *   **Impairment Loss recognized:** \$579k (FY2024) in "other expenses, net".
*   **Singapore Tooling CGU (FVLCD):**
    *   FVLCD: approx. \$11,905k
    *   Carrying Amount: \$9,967k
    *   No impairment loss required.

*   **Insight:** While two China CGUs and the Singapore Tooling CGU did not require impairment based on FVLCD, a specific **China subsidiary recognized an impairment loss of S$579k based on Value-in-Use (VIU)**, with a recoverable amount of nil. The analysis needs to explicitly state *why* this specific subsidiary (or CGU) faced impairment while others in China did not. This suggests localized operational challenges or a particularly poor outlook for that specific entity, despite the broader China manufacturing segment appearing stable. The key assumptions used for the VIU calculation (10.2% discount rate, 5-year forecast, 2% terminal growth) provide context for the valuation but do not explain the underlying operational distress of this specific subsidiary. This raises questions about asset utilization and market conditions for this particular unit.

*   **Land Area/Build-up Area:** Leasehold land: 34,000 sqm / Build-up area: 15,589 sqm.
*   **Tenure:** Leasehold 60 years expiring on 31 March 2066.

*   **Insight:** The investment property in Malaysia shows a stable fair value that slightly exceeds its carrying amount, indicating that its market value holds firm or has marginally appreciated. This provides a minor buffer against potential losses in other areas. The leasehold tenure until 2066 provides long-term operational stability.

| **Net Carrying Amount**                | **53,898** | **53,898** |

*   **Prior Year Impairment Reversal:** \$3,825k (FY2023) recognized in P&L due to improved financial performance of a China subsidiary. Recoverable amount of subsidiary in prior year: \$33,108k.
*   **Movement in Impairment Allowance:**
    *   At 1 January 2023: \$70,689k
    *   Reversal of impairment loss: (\$3,825k)
    *   At 31 December 2023: \$66,864k
    *   At 31 December 2024: \$66,864k

*   **Insight:** The Company's significant accumulated impairment losses on subsidiaries (S$66.86 million) highlight a history of poor performance or overvaluation of some investments. While a prior year reversal of S$3.83 million in FY2023 due to improved performance in a China subsidiary was positive, no further reversals occurred in FY2024. This suggests that despite the positive turnaround in continuing operations, the underlying value of some historical subsidiary investments remains heavily impaired. The forgiveness of S$12.8 million in amounts due from subsidiaries could be an attempt to restructure or provide financial relief to struggling entities, but it also indicates past financial strains within the group.

#### 3.7 Goodwill (Group)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 120; Fu Yu FS Q424, Page 14*

| **Carrying amounts**            | **–**    | **3,185** |

*   **Impairment testing:** Goodwill allocated to Supply Chain Management Services CGU.
*   **FY2024:** Goodwill fully impaired by \$3,286k (2023: \$2,678k) due to cessation of operations. Included in "other expenses, net" in discontinued operations.
*   **Prior Year (2023) VIU Key Assumptions:**
    *   Number of years projected: 5 years
    *   Pre-tax discount rate: 13.52%
    *   Revenue compound annual growth rate: 15.5%
    *   Gross profit margin: 1.46%
    *   Terminal value growth rate: 1.00%
*   **Sensitivity (Prior Year):**
    *   0.2 ppt decrease in gross profit margin would cause full impairment.
    *   11.0% decrease in forecasted revenue would cause \$72,255 impairment.

*   **Insight:** The **full impairment of goodwill (S$3.29 million) in FY2024, specifically allocated to the Supply Chain Management Services (SCM) CGU, is a critical red flag.** This impairment, explicitly stated as due to the "cessation of operations" of this segment, directly links to the significant issues uncovered in the FYSCS investigation (3.32) and the dramatic collapse in SCM revenue (3.26). The fact that a mere 0.2 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin or an 11% decrease in forecasted revenue would have caused full impairment in the prior year (2023) highlights the extreme sensitivity and precariousness of this segment's viability even before its formal cessation. This write-off underscores the severe financial consequences of the problems within the SCM business.

*   **Insight:** Group trade receivables increased by S$4.8 million, which aligns with the increase in revenue from continuing operations. The very small allowance for impairment on trade receivables (S$3k) suggests that direct customer credit risk is considered low. However, the significant amount of "Amounts due from subsidiaries" for the Company (S$24.45 million, see 3.9 for detail) is a critical component of receivables and warrants separate scrutiny due to increasing impairment allowances. The substantial decrease in "Advances to suppliers" might indicate more favorable payment terms or a reduction in certain procurement activities.

*   FY2024 impairment loss recognized: \$1,773k on current, \$2,168k on non-current.

*   **Insight:** The significant and **increasing impairment losses on amounts due from subsidiaries (S$3.94 million recognized in FY2024, bringing the total allowance to S$11.87 million)** is a major red flag. This indicates a deteriorating financial health or liquidity issues within certain subsidiaries, making it less probable for the Company to recover these intercompany loans or advances. Given the FYSCS investigation, it is highly probable that a substantial portion of these impairments relates to the financial distress and potential irrecoverability of funds from the Supply Chain Management Services segment or its related entities. This directly impacts the Company's balance sheet strength and highlights the financial contagion from the problematic subsidiary.

*   **Movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group (prior to offsetting):**
    *   At 1 January 2023: (\$1,012k)
    *   Recognized in profit or loss: \$539k
    *   Discontinued operation: \$16k
    *   Exchange differences: \$6k
    *   At 31 December 2023: (\$451k)
    *   Recognized in profit or loss: (\$68k)
    *   Exchange differences: (\$32k)
    *   At 31 December 2024: (\$551k)

*   **Unutilised tax losses (not recognized):**
    *   Group: \$10,854k (2023: \$5,648k)
    *   Expiration: 2025 and 2029 (2023: 2024 and 2028)
*   **Unutilised tax losses expired during FY2024:** \$272k (2023: \$1,627k).
*   **Unrecognized deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of subsidiaries:** \$36k (2023: \$42k) for temporary differences of \$715k (2023: \$845k).

*   **Insight:** The most concerning aspect here is the **significant increase in unrecognized unutilised tax losses for the Group, more than doubling from S$5.65 million in FY2023 to S$10.85 million in FY2024.** This indicates that the company has accumulated substantial taxable losses for which it does not expect to have sufficient future taxable profits to offset. This is a strong red flag for sustained unprofitability and could imply reduced future tax efficiency. The non-recognition of these deferred tax assets indicates management's lack of confidence in generating sufficient future taxable income. While some losses from FY2024 expired, the overwhelming majority remains unutilized, underlining the challenge in turning around the company's financial performance to a consistently profitable state.

*   **Inventories recognized as expense (included in Cost of Sales):**
    *   FY2024: \$44,318k (Group)
    *   FY2023: \$45,273k (Group)

*   **Insight:** Group inventories increased slightly in FY2024, particularly raw materials, which could indicate anticipation of increased production or slower inventory turns. A positive sign is the decrease in the allowance for stock obsolescence in FY2024, with a significant reversal of S$502k for the Group. This suggests better inventory management, reduced risk of obsolete stock, or a more favorable demand environment for older stock.

*   **Insight:** A key positive financial development is the **full repayment of all bank loans in FY2024**, eliminating this form of external debt. This significantly reduces financial risk and interest expense (3.22). The company's remaining borrowings consist solely of lease liabilities, which have increased in non-current terms. The decline in the intra-group financial guarantee by the Company for its subsidiaries (from S$167.1 million to S$118.1 million) could indicate either a reduced need for guarantees due to improved subsidiary financial health, or a strategic de-risking by the parent company in light of recent issues like FYSCS.

*   **Restricted Cash (FY2023):** \$1,558k for trade financing, \$3,508k for bank loan.
*   **Deposits with financial institutions:** Mature within 12 months, effective interest rates: 1.80%-4.90% (2024), 1.50%-5.30% (2023).
*   **Cash held in foreign exchange controlled country:** \$7,467k (2024), \$12,276k (2023).

*   **Insight:** While the Group remains in a strong net cash position, total cash and bank balances decreased by S$4.79 million. The elimination of restricted cash related to bank loans is a positive outcome of debt repayment (3.12). However, the significant amount of cash held in foreign exchange controlled countries (primarily China) might pose limitations on its immediate availability for deployment in other regions, especially given the ongoing issues with Chinese operations (3.4, 3.7, 3.9). The decline in cash held in controlled countries from S$12.28 million to S$7.47 million could imply some repatriation or increased utilization of funds within China.

*   **Issued & Paid-up Share Capital:** \$103,770,153 (2024), \$102,985,000 (2023).
*   **Issuance Details:** 5,000,000 shares issued on Jan 9, 2024 (2023: 4,000,000 shares issued on April 26, 2023) to GCEO Seow Jun Hao David, from Fu Yu Restricted Share Plan.

*   **Capital Management:**

*   **Insight:** The increase in issued shares for FY2024 (5 million shares) and FY2023 (4 million shares) stems from the issuance of shares to GCEO Seow Jun Hao David under the Restricted Share Plan (3.31). This indicates compensation and alignment incentives for key leadership. The gearing ratio remains stable and healthy, reinforcing the company's net cash position.

*   **Insight:** The foreign currency translation reserve improved (less negative) due to favorable exchange differences in FY2024 (2.3). The share-based payment reserve was fully utilized, reflecting the settlement of compensation awards (3.31). However, the continued decline in retained earnings due to net losses remains a concern for shareholder value.

*   **Insight:** Group trade payables increased, consistent with higher revenue and cost of sales in continuing operations. A notable decrease in accrued expenses suggests better management of outstanding liabilities. The disappearance of the "Cash-settled share-based payment liability" (S$785k) indicates its full settlement in FY2024 (3.31).

#### 3.17 Provision for Reinstatement Costs

| Provision for reinstatement costs | 1,186                    | 1,138                    |

*   **Movement:**
    *   Balance at 1 January 2023: \$0k
    *   Provision made: \$948k
    *   Unwinding of discount: \$190k
    *   Balance at 31 December 2023: \$1,138k
    *   Provision made: \$0k
    *   Unwinding of discount: \$48k
    *   Balance at 31 December 2024: \$1,186k

*   **Insight:** The provision for reinstatement costs relates to obligations for restoring leased properties at the end of their terms. The increase is primarily due to the unwinding of the discount on the provision, reflecting the passage of time. The absence of new provisions made in FY2024 indicates no new significant leasehold properties requiring large reinstatement cost provisions were entered into.

| :--------------------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Timing of revenue recognition**  |        |        |        |        |
| Products transferred at a point in time | 61,144 | 115,844 | 183,416 | 182,596 |
| Services transferred over time     | 3,426  | 3,349  | 7,867  | 7,785  |
| **Total Revenue**                  | **64,570** | **119,193** | **191,283** | **190,381** |

*   **Insight:** This table provides crucial detail regarding the **collapse of the Supply Chain Management Services (SCM) segment**. Its revenue dramatically fell from S$86.44 million in FY2023 to S$76.40 million in FY2024. More critically, the 1H2024 figure for SCM (S$4.43 million) against 1H2023 (S$67.87 million) shows the precipitous decline occurring *within* FY2024. This confirms the effective cessation of significant operations for this segment, which is now considered discontinued (3.26). In contrast, the Manufacturing segment shows healthy growth (S$104.14 million vs S$96.16 million), reaffirming its position as the core continuing operation. Revenue from tooling contracts also saw a healthy increase. The overall flat total revenue of S$191.28 million for FY2024 (compared to S$190.38 million in FY2023) masks the significant strategic shift and the dramatic decline in the SCM segment, which was offset by growth in manufacturing.

| Contract liabilities | (749)        | (538)        | (805)            | (147)          | (198)          | (91)               |

*   **Significant changes in Contract Assets and Liabilities (Group):**
    *   Revenue recognized from prior year balance (CL): \$242k (2023: \$622k)
    *   Cash received in advance not recognized as revenue (CL): (\$453k) (2023: (\$355k))
    *   Changes in measurement of progress (CA): \$3,534k (2023: \$1,020k)
    *   Contract assets reclassified to trade receivables (CA): (\$1,415k) (2023: (\$757k))

*   **Significant changes in Contract Assets and Liabilities (Company):**
    *   Revenue recognized from prior year balance (CL): \$159k (2023: \$68k)
    *   Cash received in advance not recognized as revenue (CL): (\$108k) (2023: (\$175k))
    *   Changes in measurement of progress (CA): \$1,166k (2023: \$289k)
    *   Contract assets reclassified to trade receivables (CA): (\$330k) (2023: (\$398k))

*   **Insight:** The significant increase in contract assets for the Group (more than doubling from S$1.89 million to S$4.01 million) suggests an increase in unbilled revenue for work completed but not yet invoiced. This could be due to more projects with revenue recognized over time or delays in billing cycles. The slight increase in contract liabilities indicates more advance payments received. The reclassification from contract assets to trade receivables reflects the natural progression of contracts as they become billable.

#### 3.20 Other Income (Group)

| Rental income: - Investment property    | 549    | 875    |
| - Sub-lease of leasehold property       | 169    | 19     |
| Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment | 192    | 24     |
| Sale of scrap and raw materials         | 245    | 634    |
| Government grants                       | 410    | 216    |

| **Total**                               | **2,225** | **1,803** |

*   **Insight:** Total other income increased in FY2024. A notable rise in income from the sub-lease of leasehold property and a significant gain on disposal of PPE contributed positively. The introduction of S$477k from "Technical and advisory services" is a new revenue stream, potentially diversifying income sources for the core business. However, rental income from investment property decreased, and sale of scrap/raw materials also saw a decline.

#### 3.21 Other Expenses, Net (Group)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 137*

| **Total**                               | **(631)** | **(537)** |

*   **Insight:** This section highlights significant non-operating expenses. The **S$579k impairment of property, plant and equipment** (as detailed in 3.4 for a China subsidiary) and S$185k in PPE written off contributed substantially to other expenses, reflecting asset devaluation or removal. While the Group benefited from a net foreign exchange gain in FY2024 compared to a loss in FY2023, the underlying asset write-downs remain a concern for asset utilization and future profitability.

#### 3.22 Finance Costs (Group)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 138*

| (S$'000)                                 | 2024   | 2023   |

| **Total**                                | **312** | **697** |

*   **Insight:** Total finance costs significantly decreased in FY2024 (S$312k vs. S$697k). This is primarily driven by the **full repayment of bank loans** (3.12), which drastically reduced interest expense on bank loans. This reduction in finance costs will positively impact future profitability.

| Depreciation of PPE and investment property | 8,374    | 8,602    |
| Staff costs (excluding directors):      |          |          |
| - salaries, bonuses and other costs     | 35,780   | 33,827   |
| - contributions to defined contribution plans | 3,310    | 3,798    |
| **Total Staff Costs**                   | **39,090** | **37,625** |
| Operating expenses related to investment property | 145      | 279      |

*   **Insight:** Total Directors' Compensation significantly decreased in FY2024 (S$1.24 million vs. S$3.83 million). This is mainly due to a reversal of equity-settled share-based payment transactions and the absence of cash-settled payments, which were high in FY2023. While overall staff costs (excluding directors) increased slightly, reflecting growth in the core manufacturing business, the reduction in directors' compensation could be seen as an adjustment in line with the company's overall financial losses. Audit fees remained relatively stable.

    *   Profit/(Loss) before income tax from continuing operations: \$150k
    *   Tax at domestic rates: \$71k
    *   Tax exempt income: (\$298k)

    *   Current year tax losses for which no DTA was recognized: \$1,074k
    *   Withholding taxes: \$102k
    *   Others: \$18k
    *   **Total Tax expense:** \$1,370k

*   **Statutory Tax Rates:**
    *   Malaysia: 24%
    *   China (general): 25%
    *   FYSZ (qualified new/high-tech): 15% (was 25% in 2023)

*   **Insight:** The Group swung from a tax credit in FY2023 to a significant tax expense of S$1.37 million in FY2024 for continuing operations. This is heavily influenced by "Current year tax losses for which no DTA was recognized" (S$1.07 million), directly linking to the issue of increasing unrecognized tax losses discussed in 3.10. This indicates that despite the marginal profit from continuing operations, the company's past losses and inability to recognize future tax benefits translate into a higher effective tax burden. The reduction in China's FYSZ tax rate to 15% for qualified entities is a positive, but its impact is clearly overshadowed by the unutilized losses.

    *   FY2024: 761,885,186
    *   FY2023: 755,723,542

*   **Insight:** The total basic loss per share improved from (1.34) cents to (0.59) cents, reflecting the reduced overall net loss. Crucially, the loss per share from *continuing operations* significantly improved from (1.01) cents to (0.16) cents, indicating progress in the core business. However, the loss per share from *discontinued operations* (SCM) worsened slightly (from 0.33 cents to 0.35 cents), confirming that the SCM segment continued to be a drag on profitability even as its operations ceased. This reinforces the narrative that while manufacturing is slowly stabilizing, the legacy issues of the SCM segment continue to impact shareholder value.

| **Net cash flow for the year**         | **(63)** | **(4,264)** | **5,472** | **(4,807)** |

*   **Insight:** This section provides stark evidence of the **massive collapse of the Supply Chain Management Services (SCM) segment**, which is now classified as a discontinued operation.
    *   **Revenue Decline:** The segment's revenue plummeted from S$86.44 million in FY2023 to S$76.40 million in FY2024. More granularly, revenue in 2H24 was a mere S$4.43 million compared to S$67.87 million in 2H23, a **93% drop in just one half-year**. This precipitous decline signifies the effective cessation of significant business activity in this segment.
    *   **Persistent Losses:** Despite this dramatic revenue reduction and operational wind-down, the segment continued to generate substantial losses, increasing from S$(2.51) million in FY2023 to S$(2.67) million in FY2024. This indicates significant ongoing costs and liabilities even after the cessation of operations.
    *   **Link to FYSCS Investigation:** The "Other expenses, net" line for discontinued operations includes the **S$3.29 million goodwill impairment** (3.7) directly linked to the cessation of this segment's operations. This, combined with the "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," and "irregular expense claims" flagged in the FYSCS investigation (3.32), paints a clear picture of severe internal control failures and potential misconduct that drove this segment's demise and its continued financial drain on the Group. The subsequent Evertree claim (3.33) for S$1.67 million also directly impacts this segment's liabilities.
    *   **Cash Flow Impact:** While the segment surprisingly generated positive net cash flow of S$5.47 million in FY2024 (likely from liquidation of assets or collection of receivables), it had a significant negative cash flow in FY2023. The transition reflects the process of winding down rather than healthy operational performance.
    *   **Overall:** The SCM segment is clearly the primary source of financial distress and governance concerns for the entire Group, its collapse directly impacting the Group's net loss and requiring substantial write-offs.

*   **Insight:** Capital expenditure contracted for but not yet recognized significantly decreased from S$5.42 million in FY2023 to S$1.39 million in FY2024. This suggests a reduced pipeline of major capital projects, potentially reflecting a more cautious investment approach or the completion of larger projects in prior periods. This could also imply a reduction in future growth initiatives or a focus on optimizing existing assets rather than expanding capacity.

*   **Other Related Party Transactions (Group):**
    *   Purchase of services (Related party not within the Group): \$73k (2023: \$21k)

*   **Insight:** Total Key Management Personnel (KMP) compensation significantly decreased from S$5.95 million in FY2023 to S$3.27 million in FY2024. This substantial reduction is primarily attributable to the non-cash component of share-based payment transactions (a reversal of S$759k in FY2024 compared to a S$1.34 million expense in FY2023, see 3.31). While short-term employee benefits also decreased slightly, the overall drop in KMP compensation reflects the challenging financial performance of the Group and adjustments in equity-linked remuneration.

    *   Income from sub-leasing: (\$169k) (2023: (\$19k))
    *   Expenses relating to short-term leases: \$139k (2023: \$101k)
    *   **Total cash outflow for leases:** \$1,521k (2023: \$1,375k)

    *   **Total:** \$1,137k (2023: \$3,554k)

*   **Insight:** The Group's right-of-use (ROU) assets increased significantly in FY2024, with additions of S$2.44 million. This, along with the corresponding lease liabilities (3.12), indicates an increased reliance on leasing arrangements for land and buildings. The higher cash outflow for leases and increasing income from sub-leasing suggest active management of the leased property portfolio.

*   **Cash-settled RSP Awards Movements:**
    *   Tranche I (5,000k shares): Vested FY2022, fully settled in cash (\$1,012k) during FY2022 & FY2023.
    *   Tranche II (5,000k shares): Vested Dec 31, 2023, settled by issuance of 5,000k shares Jan 9, 2024.
    *   Carrying amount at 1 January 2024: \$785k
    *   Reclassification to Equity-settled: (\$785k)
    *   Carrying amount at 31 December 2024: \$0k

*   **Equity-settled RSP Awards - Key Assumptions for Performance Conditions:**
    *   Share price at grant date: 21.50 cents
    *   Fair value (cents): FY2022 (20.70), FY2023 (19.20), FY2024 (18.10), FY2025 (17.10), FY2026 (16.10)
    *   Expected dividends: 7.2%
    *   Probability of meeting performance conditions: Best (30%), Base (60%), Worst (10%)
    *   Revenue growth rate (Manufacturing): 8-24% (2024), 8-51% (2023)
    *   Gross profit margin (Manufacturing): 16% (2024), 19% (2023)

*   **Movement in Share Awards Reserve:**
    *   Outstanding at 1 January 2023: \$915k
    *   Share-based payment expense recognized: \$671k
    *   Issuance of shares: (\$827k)
    *   Outstanding at 31 December 2023: \$759k
    *   Share-based payment expense (reversed)/recognized: (\$759k)
    *   Issuance of shares: (\$785k)
    *   Reclassification from cash-settled: \$785k
    *   Outstanding at 31 December 2024: \$0k

*   **Reconciliation of Outstanding RSP Awards ('000):**
    *   Outstanding at 1 January 2023: 25,000
    *   Vested during the year: (9,000) (Tranche III, IV)
    *   Outstanding at 31 December 2023: 16,000
    *   Vested during the year: (0) (Tranche II vested Jan 9, 2024)
    *   Outstanding at 31 December 2024: 16,000

*   **Insight:** The Restricted Share Plan (RSP) for GCEO Seow Jun Hao David is a significant component of his compensation and provides a view into future performance incentives. The vesting conditions for Tranches III-VII are tied to revenue and PBT targets, directly linking executive compensation to financial performance. The issuance of 5 million shares on Jan 9, 2024, settling Tranche II, is a notable equity movement. The reversal of share-based payment expense in FY2024 (S$759k, see 3.23) indicates that some performance conditions for prior tranches may not have been met or were re-evaluated, aligning with the Group's recent financial losses. This implies that the initial optimistic assumptions (e.g., 60% probability for base case performance conditions) might have been overly ambitious. The remaining 16 million unvested awards represent a substantial future compensation commitment, contingent on meeting aggressive revenue growth and gross profit margin targets for the manufacturing segment.

#### 3.32 Ongoing Investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte. Ltd. (FYSCS)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 155*

*   **Internal Audit Report (July 26, 2024, received Aug 7, 2024):** Overall assessment rating of "4" (Cause for considerable concern) for FYSCS. Highlighted significant weaknesses in risk management process.
*   **Damodara Ong LLC Engagement (Oct 8, 2024):** Engaged to investigate.
*   **Interim Status Update Report (Feb 5, 2025, announced Feb 6, 2025):**
    1.  Unverifiable arrangements for US\$2,984,501 payment to third party (services not rendered, potential conflict of interest).
    2.  Unauthorized usage of email account bd@fuyu-scs.com.
    3.  Questions regarding secondment and conduct of former general manager (May 2023 - May 2024).
    4.  Irregular expense claims by former employee for self and current employee.
*   **Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte Ltd Appointment (Feb 11, 2025):** Appointed to investigate issues in Interim Report.
*   **Claims by Group (Announced April 1, 2025):** Intent to make claims against certain persons for:
    *   AEPL Acquisition Claim (acquisition of Avantgarde Enterprise Pte Ltd, now FYSCS).
    *   FYSCS Claim (purported misuse of FYSCS's resources).
    *   Pre-Paid Commission Claim (payment of US\$2,984,501).
*   Investigation ongoing as of financial statement date. Auditors unable to determine full financial impact. Board opines internal controls of SCM segment may be inadequate.

*   **Insight:** This section is **the most critical and concerning disclosure** in the entire Annual Report, directly explaining the massive financial hits observed throughout the financials (e.g., goodwill impairment in 3.7, discontinued operations losses in 3.26, intercompany receivable impairments in 3.9, Evertree claim in 3.33).
    *   **Severe Governance Failure:** The "Overall assessment rating of '4' (Cause for considerable concern)" from the internal audit and the detailed findings of "unverifiable arrangements," "unauthorized usage," and "irregular expense claims" point to fundamental, severe weaknesses in corporate governance and internal controls within the FYSCS segment.
    *   **Financial Impact Uncertainty:** The auditors' inability to "determine full financial impact" highlights the significant financial uncertainty and potential for further liabilities or write-downs beyond what has already been recognized. This includes the S$2.98 million pre-paid commission claim, which is now subject to legal action.
    *   **Board Admission:** The Board's acknowledgment that "internal controls of SCM segment may be inadequate" is a significant admission of a systemic failure, raising questions about the oversight mechanisms for the entire Group.
    *   **Legal Action:** The intent to make claims against "certain persons" related to the acquisition and misuse of FYSCS resources underscores the seriousness of the alleged misconduct. This investigation represents a significant reputational risk and could incur substantial legal costs and further financial recovery challenges. This is **the single biggest red flag for investors and stakeholders**, suggesting a high risk of financial irregularities and calling into question the integrity of past financial reporting related to the SCM segment.

#### 3.33 Subsequent Event (Evertree's Claim)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 156*

*   **June 12, 2024:** FYSCS received letter of demand from Evertree Hongkong Limited for US\$925,773.57 (approx. \$1.24 million) for services under alleged profit sharing agreement (Sept 1, 2023).
*   **June 4, 2025:** Arbitral tribunal ruled in favor of Evertree.
*   **Amount payable:** Approx. \$1.67 million (including interest, legal, arbitration costs), recorded in financial statements.

*   **Insight:** The arbitration ruling in favor of Evertree, resulting in an approximate **S$1.67 million payment liability**, is a direct financial consequence of the problematic SCM segment (FYSCS). This claim relates to a "profit sharing agreement," which, in light of the FYSCS investigation's findings of "unverifiable arrangements" and "services not rendered," raises further questions about the legitimacy and oversight of contracts entered into by FYSCS. This event confirms a concrete financial impact from the internal control weaknesses and alleged misconduct.

*   **Insight:**
    *   **Credit Risk:** The negligible impairment on trade receivables (S$3k) suggests low credit risk with external customers. However, the significantly higher and increasing impairment on *intercompany* receivables (3.9) remains a key credit risk within the Group structure. Geographically, Singapore and China represent the largest portions of receivables. The increase in amounts past due more than 90 days, though small in absolute value (S$812k), warrants monitoring.
    *   **Liquidity Risk:** The company's liquidity position appears manageable, especially with the full repayment of bank loans (3.12). Most liabilities are current trade payables, with lease liabilities spread over multiple years. The current assets cover current liabilities well.
    *   **Market Risk (Interest Rate):** The shift from variable rate bank loans to only fixed-rate lease liabilities (for financial liabilities) reduces exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The fixed-rate financial assets (deposits) provide stable interest income.
    *   **Foreign Currency Risk:** The Group has a significant net long exposure to the US Dollar (S$26.75 million). This means the Group benefits from a strengthening USD but is vulnerable to a weakening USD. Given the global nature of its manufacturing and the recent SCM issues, currency fluctuations remain a notable, albeit managed, risk.

*   **Concentration of Revenue (Customers > 10% of Group Revenue):**
    *   FY2024: 3 customers, all from Supply Chain Management Services segment. Total \$69,774k.
        *   Customer 1: \$24,095k (FY2023: \$23,341k)
        *   Customer 2: \$22,707k (FY2023: \$0k)
        *   Customer 3: \$22,972k (FY2023: \$0k)
    *   FY2023: 1 customer, from Supply Chain Management Services segment. Total \$23,341k.

*   **Insight:**
    *   **SCM Segment Collapse Confirmed:** This section vividly illustrates the dramatic decline of the SCM segment. Its external revenue for FY2024 was S$76.40 million, a 11.6% decrease from FY2023, but the 1H2024 figure of S$4.43 million against 1H2023's S$67.87 million shows the **real-time collapse of this business within FY2024.** The segment's significant losses before tax (S$(2.48) million in FY2024, S$(2.44) million in FY2023), heavily burdened by the **S$3.29 million goodwill impairment**, underscore its detrimental impact on the Group's overall profitability. This data directly supports the narrative of internal control failures and issues flagged by the FYSCS investigation (3.32).
    *   **Manufacturing Resilience (But Regional Challenges):** The Manufacturing segment showed strong growth in external revenue (S$114.89 million vs S$103.94 million), confirming its role as the core continuing operation. While Malaysia's manufacturing operations appear profitable, China's manufacturing segment consistently reported losses (S$(4.90) million in FY2024, S$(3.29) million in FY2023) and recognized an impairment of PPE (S$579k). Singapore's manufacturing segment also swung to a loss before tax in FY2024 (S$(2.83) million from S$1.93 million profit), despite revenue growth. This indicates that the core manufacturing business, while growing, faces profitability challenges in key regions, particularly China and Singapore, offsetting the positive performance in Malaysia.
    *   **Revenue Concentration Risk:** The extreme concentration of revenue in the SCM segment (3 customers contributing S$69.77 million in FY2024), now a discontinued operation, highlights a significant historical business risk. The exit from this segment, while painful, eliminates this concentration risk in the future, albeit at the cost of substantial revenue and asset write-offs.

| **Total liabilities**               | **37,052**         | **38,747**         |              |              |

*   **Capital Expenditure (excluding ROU assets):**
    *   FY2024: Manufacturing: \$6,940k; SCM: \$0k. Total Group: \$6,940k
    *   FY2023: Manufacturing: \$3,735k; SCM: \$1k. Total Group: \$3,736k

*   **Insight:**
    *   **SCM Asset Swelling (and questions):** It is highly counter-intuitive that the SCM segment's non-current assets jumped from S$3.35 million in FY2023 to S$31.15 million in FY2024, given its "cessation of operations" and full goodwill impairment. This dramatic increase in non-current assets *for a segment being discontinued* needs significant clarification. What constitutes these assets, and what is their future utility or recoverability? This raises questions about the asset classification and valuation policies within the context of a winding-down operation, especially when contrasted with the goodwill impairment. Similarly, SCM segment liabilities also increased significantly, from S$3.88 million to S$8.79 million, reflecting the accumulating financial obligations of this troubled unit, likely including the Evertree claim (3.33).
    *   **Manufacturing Investment:** Capital expenditure for the Manufacturing segment more than doubled from S$3.74 million in FY2023 to S$6.94 million in FY2024. This confirms the company's focus on investing in its core manufacturing capabilities, aligning with its strategic pivot.
    *   **Unallocated Items:** The presence of "unallocated" assets and liabilities (e.g., S$806k unallocated non-current assets and S$2.62 million unallocated liabilities in FY2024) hinders a completely clear segment-specific financial health assessment. While some level of unallocated items is normal, large or unexplained figures can reduce transparency.

*   **Registered Office:** 8 Tuas Drive 1 Singapore 638675
*   **Tel:** (65) 6578 7338
*   **Website:** www.fuyucorp.com
*   **Share Registrar:** Boardroom Corporate & Advisory Services Pte. Ltd.
*   **External Auditors:** Baker Tilly TFW LLP (Audit Partner: Guo Shuqi, since FY2023)

*   **Insight:** The engagement of Baker Tilly TFW LLP as external auditors (with a new audit partner since FY2023) is a standard practice. The company maintains dual investor relations contacts, suggesting a commitment to shareholder communication.

#### 5.2 Board of Directors
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Pages 1, 10-12, 72-73*

*   **Current Board:**
    *   Huang Junli, Christopher (Chairman, Independent Non-Executive Director)
    *   Seow Jun Hao David (Executive Director, Group Chief Executive Officer)
    *   Poh Kai Ren, Daniel (Independent Non-Executive Director)
    *   Tan Tong Loong Royston (Independent Non-Executive Director)

*   **Committees:**
    *   **Audit Committee:** Poh Kai Ren, Daniel (Chairman), Huang Junli, Christopher, Tan Tong Loong Royston
    *   **Nominating Committee:** Tan Tong Loong Royston (Chairman), Huang Junli, Christopher, Poh Kai Ren, Daniel
    *   **Remuneration Committee:** Huang Junli, Christopher (Chairman), Tan Tong Loong Royston, Poh Kai Ren, Daniel
*   **Company Secretary:** Janet Tan

*   **Insight:** The current board composition includes one Executive Director (GCEO) and three Independent Non-Executive Directors, providing a majority of independent oversight. The roles of Chairman and GCEO are separate, a positive governance practice. However, the complete lack of gender diversity (100% male, as noted in 1.10) remains a significant concern, limiting varied perspectives at the highest level of leadership, especially given the complex challenges the company faces.

#### 5.3 Key Executives
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Pages 12-14*

*   **Seow Jun Hao David:** Executive Director, Group Chief Executive Officer (Appointed ED Jan 18, 2021; GCEO Sep 16, 2022)
*   **Lim Geok Siong, Jason:** Chief Operating Officer (Joined Feb 2023)
*   **Low Sheng, Adriel:** Deputy Chief Operating Officer (Joined Feb 2023)
*   **Ong Lizhen, Daisy:** Chief Financial Officer (Joined Jan 2023)
*   **Teh Tuan Hock:** General Manager of Fu Hao Penang (Joined May 2003)
*   **Hoo Liang Hock:** Country Head of China, General Manager of Fu Yu Dongguan and Zhuhai (Joined Jun 2019; Country Head Jul 2023)
*   **Bai Feng:** General Manager of Fu Yu Suzhou (Joined Jul 2021)

*   **Insight:** The company has seen several key executive appointments in early 2023 (COO, Deputy COO, CFO), indicating a relatively new leadership team below the GCEO level. This could be a positive sign for renewal and fresh perspectives in light of past performance issues, but also introduces a period of integration and execution risk for new strategies. The presence of long-serving General Managers and Country Heads provides operational stability.

(\*) By invitation

*   **Insight:** All current directors demonstrate full attendance at Board and committee meetings, indicating their commitment to their oversight responsibilities. The GCEO's attendance "by invitation" at AC, RC, and NC meetings is standard practice to provide management insights without participating in independent decision-making.

\* Hew Lien Lee retired as Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer with effect from 25 April 2024.
*   **Aggregate remuneration paid or payable to Directors for FY2024:** S\$2,209,236.

*   **Insight:** The remuneration for GCEO Seow Jun Hao David (S$1.07 million) is substantial, with a high proportion in salary and bonus. The absence of a Restricted Share Plan component in his FY2024 remuneration (as opposed to FY2023's total directors' compensation which had share-based payments (3.23)) reflects the accounting treatment of equity-settled vs. cash-settled awards as detailed in 3.31. Non-executive directors receive fees below S$100,000, which is generally considered appropriate for their independent oversight role. The aggregate remuneration for all directors shows a significant decrease from FY2023 (S$2.21 million vs S$3.83 million, as per 3.23), largely due to the change in share-based payment accounting.

#### 5.7 Key Management Personnel (KMP) Remuneration Bands (FY2024)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 86*

| Remuneration Band and Number of Key Management Personnel | Salary (%) | Bonus Allowances and Benefits (%) | Total (%) |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------- |
| S\$500,000 – S\$749,999 (1 KMP)                          | 61.4       | 34.1                              | 100.0     |
| S\$250,000 – S\$499,999 (2 KMP)                          | 73.6       | 22.1                              | 100.0     |
| Below S\$250,000 (4 KMP)                                 | 75.1       | 14.5                              | 100.0     |

*   **Aggregate remuneration paid to the seven (7) KMP (excluding directors and GCEO) for FY2024:** S\$2,041,000.

*   **Insight:** The aggregate remuneration for KMP (excluding directors and GCEO) slightly decreased from S$2.13 million in FY2023 (3.28) to S$2.04 million in FY2024. The remuneration bands show that a significant portion of KMP compensation is base salary, with variable components (bonus, allowances, benefits) being smaller.

#### 5.8 Immediate Family Members of GCEO Remuneration (FY2024)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 87*

| Name of Employee        | Salary (%) | Bonus (%) | Allowances and Benefits (%) | Total (%) |
| :---------------------- | :--------- | :-------- | :-------------------------- | :-------- |
| Below S\$250,000        |            |           |                             |           |
| Seow E-lin, Elaine (1)  | 85.6       | 7.1       | 7.3                         | 100.0     |

(1) Seow E-lin, Elaine's last day of service with the Company was 25 March 2025.

*   **Insight:** The disclosure of remuneration for Seow E-lin, Elaine, an immediate family member of the GCEO, is critical for transparency. Her departure on March 25, 2025, **shortly after the FY2024 year-end and the interim report on the FYSCS investigation (announced Feb 6, 2025)**, warrants critical attention. This timing raises questions about whether her departure was voluntary or related to the ongoing internal control and misconduct issues. Given the "unauthorized usage of email account bd@fuyu-scs.com" and "irregular expense claims by former employee" noted in the investigation (3.32), any departure of personnel connected to the GCEO and company operations during this period should be scrutinized for potential links.

#### 5.9 Substantial Shareholder Remuneration (FY2024)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 87*

| Name of Employee       | Salary (%) | Bonus (%) | Allowances and Benefits (%) | Total (%) |
| :--------------------- | :--------- | :-------- | :-------------------------- | :-------- |
| S\$250,000 – S\$499,999 |            |           |                             |           |
| Lim Wei De, Victor (1) | 85.3       | 10.0      | 4.7                         | 100.0     |

(1) Lim Wei De, Victor's last day of service with the Company was 8 March 2025.

*   **Insight:** Similarly, the remuneration of Lim Wei De, Victor, a substantial shareholder (see 5.14) and his departure on March 8, 2025, also **shortly after the FY2024 year-end and the interim report on the FYSCS investigation (announced Feb 6, 2025)**, is highly significant. The timing of his exit, coinciding with the unraveling of the FYSCS issues, raises the same critical questions as Seow E-lin's departure. Such high-profile departures of individuals with significant financial and familial ties to the company during a period of intense scrutiny for internal controls and potential misconduct suggest a possible fallout from the ongoing investigations and could signal deeper underlying issues or attempts to manage public perception.

| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Fu Yu Corporation Limited - ordinary shares                  |                                        |                                         |                                         |
| Seow Jun Hao David                                           | 4,000,000 (1)                          | 9,000,000 (1)                           | 9,000,000 (1)                           |

(1) Of the shares held by Seow Jun Hao David, 4,000,000 shares are registered under OCBC Nominees Singapore Private Limited.

*   **Insight:** GCEO Seow Jun Hao David significantly increased his direct shareholding from 4 million to 9 million shares during FY2024, primarily through the vesting of his Restricted Share Plan awards (3.14, 3.31). While this increases his alignment with shareholder interests, the decline in unvested awards from 21 million to 16 million signifies the vesting of some performance-based compensation.

#### 5.11 Restricted Share Plan Outstanding Awards
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 102*

| Year of award | Granted    | Number of holders | Holding at beginning of year | Vested | Holding at end of the year |
| :------------ | :--------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :----- | :------------------------- |
| 2022          | 30,000,000 | 1                 | 16,000,000                   | –      | 16,000,000                 |

*   **Insight:** This table focuses only on awards from the 2022 plan. The 16 million outstanding awards are held by a single holder (GCEO Seow Jun Hao David, as per 5.10), emphasizing the concentration of long-term incentives at the very top.

#### 5.12 Share Options
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 103*

*   **During FY2024:**
    *   No options granted.
    *   No shares issued by exercise of option.
*   **As at end of FY2024:** No unissued shares under options.

*   **Insight:** The company did not grant or exercise any share options in FY2024, indicating that restricted share plans (RSP) are the primary vehicle for equity-based compensation.

#### 5.13 Shareholdings Statistics (As at 3 June 2025)

*   **Public float:** 69.37% of issued and paid-up shares held by public. (Complied with Rule 723).

*   **Insight:** The shareholding structure shows a healthy public float of 69.37%, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements for listed companies. However, a significant concentration of shares (68.29%) is held by a small number of large shareholders (55 individuals/entities), indicating potential influence by a few key stakeholders.

#### 5.14 Substantial Shareholders (As at 3 June 2025)
*Source: Fu Yu 24 AR, Page 172*

| Name              | Direct interest | % of Direct Interest | Deemed interest | % of Deemed Interest |

| Lim Wei De Victor | 224,392,511     | 29.45                | –               | –                    |

*   **Insight:** Lim Wei De Victor is the largest substantial shareholder, holding a significant 29.45% direct interest. His recent departure from the company as an employee (5.9) is a significant development given his substantial ownership, raising questions about his future involvement and the implications for governance and strategic direction.

*   **Insight:** The top 20 shareholders collectively hold over 60% of the shares, indicating a concentrated ownership structure. While this can facilitate quick decision-making, it also means that the interests and actions of a few major shareholders or nominees can heavily influence the company's direction. The presence of GCEO Seow Jun Hao David and former GCEO Hew Lien Lee among the top 20 highlights their continued vested interest in the company's performance.
