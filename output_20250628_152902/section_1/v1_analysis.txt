**Geographical Distribution of Manufacturing Operations (by Revenue Contribution Percentages):**

The Group's manufacturing segment is strategically reported across these three geographical segments based on the location of assets [SOURCE: Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, page 26]. The distribution of manufacturing revenue indicates the relative scale of operations in each region.

| Geographical Segment | Contribution to Total Manufacturing Revenue (FY2024) | Source                                   |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Singapore            | 40.2%                                                | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, page 8]       |
| Malaysia             | 31.9%                                                | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, page 8]       |
| China                | 27.9%                                                | [Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, page 8]       |

**Alignment with Business Strategy:**
The multi-country presence supports the Group's objective of serving an "international, diverse and loyal customer base" [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1]. Singapore, as the headquarters and home to the advanced Smart Factory, serves as a hub for high-precision, high-value manufacturing, particularly for the burgeoning biomedical sector. Operations in Malaysia and China likely provide access to diverse labor markets, potentially lower manufacturing costs, and closer proximity to key supply chains or customer bases in those regions. The balanced contribution percentages across the three regions in FY2024 suggest a diversified operational base.

### d. Any Significant Changes or Trends in the Operating Footprint

*   **Discontinuation of Supply Chain Management Services Segment:** A significant change in the Group's operating footprint is the discontinuation of its Supply Chain Management Services Segment in the last quarter of FY2024 [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 5, page 19, page 65; Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, page 11, page 26]. Prior to discontinuation, this segment generated S$72.0 million in revenue in 1H2024 [SOURCE: Fuyu Pres H124_m.md, page 5], indicating it was a substantial part of the business. This move streamlines the Group's focus primarily on its core manufacturing activities, including the manufacture and sub-assembly of precision plastic parts and components and the fabrication of precision moulds and dies [SOURCE: Fu Yu FS Q424_m.md, page 26].
*   **Launch of Fu Yu Biomedical:** In 2023, the Group launched Fu Yu Biomedical, signifying a strategic pivot or intensified focus on the development of high-precision devices, life sciences products, and consumables within the Medical Technology and Biotechnology sectors [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1]. This initiative leverages existing assets like the Smart Factory's 100K-class cleanroom [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1, page 6].
*   **Investment in Advanced Manufacturing:** The detailed description of the Smart Factory's optimization for workflow and equipment with Industry 4.0 machinery [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 6] suggests ongoing investment in technological upgrades to enhance manufacturing capabilities and efficiency.

### e. How the Operating Structure Supports Competitive Positioning

Fu Yu's operating structure supports its competitive positioning through several key aspects:

*   **Comprehensive Service Offering (Vertical Integration):** Providing a "one-stop solution" from product design to assembly and testing allows Fu Yu to act as a complete manufacturing partner [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1]. This reduces complexity for customers and offers a competitive advantage over fragmented suppliers.
*   **High-End Precision Specialization:** The focus on high-end precision plastic and metal components positions Fu Yu in demanding markets where quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1]. This specialization differentiates them from general manufacturers.
*   **Advanced Technological Capabilities:** The flagship Smart Factory, with its capabilities in 3D metal printing, high precision tooling, and a 100K-class cleanroom for biomedical products, demonstrates a commitment to leading-edge manufacturing technology [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1, page 6]. This enables the Group to handle complex projects and serve advanced industries.
*   **Strategic Geographic Diversification:** Operating in Singapore, Malaysia, and China provides a diversified base for production and market access. Singapore supports high-value and R&D-intensive activities (e.g., biomedical), while other locations may optimize for cost-effectiveness or proximity to regional markets. This broad footprint enhances resilience and market reach [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1].
*   **Robust Quality and Industry Certifications:** The Group holds a comprehensive set of ISO and IATF certifications across its key entities, including ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management), ISO 13485:2016 (Medical Devices Quality Management), ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management), and IATF 16949:2016 (Automotive Quality Management) [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 16]. These certifications are critical for gaining and maintaining customer trust, especially in highly regulated sectors like medical and automotive, significantly strengthening its competitive standing.
*   **Established Reputation and Scale:** As Singapore's oldest and one of Asia's largest manufacturers, established since 1978, Fu Yu boasts a long history and substantial scale, which contributes to brand recognition, customer loyalty, and operational efficiencies [SOURCE: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 1].
