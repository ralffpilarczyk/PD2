ANALYTICAL_PATTERNS:
-   **Prioritize actionable recommendations derived from root cause analysis.** The most valuable insights move beyond descriptive findings to diagnose underlying issues and propose specific, implementable solutions that leverage direct operational levers.
-   **Quantify the impact of key operational findings and proposed changes.** Demonstrating the tangible benefits (e.g., cost savings, time reduction, efficiency gains, throughput increase) of insights significantly increases their perceived value and drives adoption.
-   **Systematically map key processes to visually identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and critical path dependencies.** This approach makes complex operational flows transparent and immediately highlights areas ripe for optimization and performance improvement.
-   **Analyze the direct relationships between resource allocation, process throughput, and overall operational efficiency.** Understanding these correlations reveals optimal resource utilization strategies, identifies performance drivers, and informs resource re-prioritization.

FAILURE_PREVENTION:
-   **Avoid stopping at descriptive analysis; always probe for underlying root causes and systemic drivers.** Initial drafts often describe symptoms; true value comes from diagnosing the core issues, which requires asking "why" repeatedly to reach fundamental insights.
-   **Establish a comprehensive data and scope checklist at the outset to prevent missing critical information or operational steps.** Proactively identify all necessary metrics, processes, and relevant stakeholder perspectives to avoid "completeness improvements" later in the analysis cycle.
-   **Clearly define the analytical questions and desired actionable outcomes before commencing data collection and analysis.** This ensures the initial draft is purpose-driven, minimizing the need for extensive "insight generation improvements" to make findings relevant and impactful.
-   **Do not present findings without clear implications or a 'so what' for operational stakeholders.** Ensure every observation points towards a potential improvement, risk, or decision point, moving beyond mere factual recitation to immediate utility.

SECTION_INSIGHTS:
-   **Ground all operational analysis in specific process steps and their associated performance metrics (KPIs).** An operational section must clearly delineate the "how" of current operations and use quantitative measures to evaluate efficiency, cost, time, and quality.
-   **Always include a clear "problem-solution-impact" framework for each operational finding.** For every identified issue, present the root cause, a concrete recommendation for improvement, and a quantified estimate of its positive impact (e.g., X% efficiency gain, Y cost reduction).
-   **Address the interdependencies of operational processes across departments and systems.** Missed requirements often include the impact on other teams, necessary technology integrations, required changes in roles/responsibilities, and cross-functional ownership.
-   **Provide practical, step-by-step recommendations for implementation, including potential ownership, required resources, and realistic timelines.** Operational sections are inherently action-oriented; vague suggestions are insufficient and reduce the analytical output's utility.
-   **Incorporate risk assessment and mitigation strategies for proposed operational changes.** This ensures the analysis is comprehensive, considers potential disruptions or unintended consequences, and enhances the overall credibility and polish of the recommendations.
