*N/A data for FY2022 and 2H22 (due to restructuring) limits long-term trend analysis for continuing operations, requiring focus on FY2023-FY2024.*

### 2. Key Financial Performance & Trends

The Group's FY2024 performance aligned with management's outlook for stable total revenue and narrowed net loss. The Chairman highlighted significant improvements in continuing operations' net loss and EBITDA.

*   **Revenue Evolution:** Total revenue stagnated in FY2024 (0.5% growth to S$191.3M) following a 20.7% decline in FY2023. This was despite healthy 10.5% growth in continuing operations (manufacturing) revenue to S$114.9M, largely offset by a **dramatic decline** in the discontinued supply chain management services segment in 2H24. The near-total evaporation of discontinued operations revenue in 2H24 (from S$71.9M in 1H24 to S$4.5M) is a **major red flag**, suggesting rapid, unmanaged wind-down or misstatement, severely impacting total revenue visibility. Manufacturing growth was strong in 2H24 (up 17.2% to S$60.1M vs 2H23 S$51.3M), driven by new projects.

*   **Margin Evolution:** EBITDA Margin for Continuing Operations substantially improved in FY2024 to 7.4% (from 0.6% in FY2023), indicating enhanced operational efficiency. **However, the interim trend is concerning:** margins declined significantly in 2H24 (3.0%) compared to 1H24 (4.6%), and even more sharply against 1H23 (12.0%) and 2H23 (10.7%). This **H2 2024 margin erosion for the core business is the most immediate operational concern**, suggesting the annual 'turnaround' might be unsustainable or already reversing despite stated cost management successes. Operating and Net Margins for continuing operations also improved annually (Operating Margin positive 0.4% in FY2024 from negative 7.1%) but remained negative or very low in interim periods.

*   **Cash Flow Generation:** Net Cash from Operating Activities reversed from a significant S$(4.5)M outflow in FY2023 to a positive S$3.6M inflow in FY2024, driven by improved working capital and lower losses. Strong 1H24 operating cash flow (S$3.6M) largely drove this, with 2H24 turning slightly negative (S$(0.1)M). Cash Conversion (OCF/EBITDA) improved dramatically to 42.4% (from -756.2%), but **extreme volatility across interim periods (1H24: 142.8% vs. 2H24: -3.1%) indicates inconsistent cash management and predictability concerns.** Capex significantly ramped up in FY2024 (S$6.9M vs S$4.0M), reflecting healthy investments in factory equipment. Cash and cash equivalents remained stable at S$55.5M.

### 3. Performance Assessment & Strategic Context

*   **Key Drivers & Achievements:** The core manufacturing business (continuing operations) showed strong revenue growth and improved gross margins (13.5% in FY2024 from 11.7% in FY2023), especially in Singapore and Malaysia, due to new project wins in medical and consumer segments. Cost management was crucial, with a 20.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Strategic investments in the Smart Factory and new product introduction (NPI) team contributed to securing new customers and higher-margin projects. The proactive cessation of loss-making Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions (FYSCS) in Q4 FY2024, despite a S$3.3M goodwill impairment and a S$2.7M FY2024 loss from discontinued operations, is a positive strategic step to streamline focus on high-precision manufacturing.

*   **Key Challenges:** The primary operational challenge is the significant 2H24 core business margin erosion, which casts doubt on the sustainability of annual profitability improvements. Furthermore, the FYSCS cessation revealed serious underlying issues, including an internal audit highlighting "significant weaknesses" and an ongoing investigation into "purported misuse of FYSCS's resources." These point to deeper governance and internal control failures within the Group.

*   **Limitations:** The analysis is limited by the **absence of specific, granular guidance for the core continuing operations**, which hinders accountability assessment for a company undergoing a core business transformation. Additionally, the **lack of industry benchmarks** prevents a true assessment of whether the observed "improvements" represent a competitive advantage or merely a rebound from a very low base in a "challenging operating environment."

### 4. Critical Discrepancies & Governance Concerns

*   **Fundamental Discrepancy in Core EBITDA Reporting:** Management's "Financial Highlights" in the Annual Report states "EBITDA from Continuing Operations increased more than 14-fold to S$8.5 million from S$0.6 million" for FY2024 and FY2023 respectively. However, the "Reportable Segments" table in the Q424 Interim Financial Statements, which provides "Segment profit/ (loss) before tax*" (a proxy for EBITDA from Manufacturing, the continuing operation), shows **vastly different figures: S$4.37M for FY2024 and S$11.77M for FY2023**. This is not a minor definitional difference but a **fundamental contradiction** in a critical non-GAAP profitability metric. If the segment reporting is accurate, management's entire narrative of a "14-fold increase" in core EBITDA is **factually misleading**, implying a significant *decline* in core "EBITDA" from FY2023 to FY2024. This profoundly undermines the credibility of management's financial highlights and raises serious questions about the transparency and accuracy of their non-GAAP reporting, impacting the reliability of all other performance claims.

*   **Downplaying the Severity and Broader Implications of FYSCS Issues:** While the Chairman's Message mentions the S$3.3M goodwill impairment and states the Board is "investigating the past affairs," it explicitly reiterates that "these investigations are isolated solely to FYSCS, and do not impact our continuing operations." However, the independent auditor issued a **qualified opinion** specifically due to the "ongoing investigation into affairs of Fu Yu Supply Chain Solutions Pte Ltd," stating they "were unable to determine the potential financial impact, if any." This qualified opinion, along with the subsequent S$1.67M claim in favor of Evertree Hongkong Limited and reported "significant weaknesses," indicates a more substantial, unresolved risk and financial impact than management's commentary suggests. More critically, it points to deeper **governance and internal control failures within the Group** that allowed such issues to occur. This significantly erodes investor trust and raises questions about the robustness of the company's financial controls and oversight mechanisms for *all* operations, not just the discontinued one, posing a material risk to the company's reputation and potential future capital raising efforts.

### Data Sources and Methodologies

*   **^19 N/A Data:** Continuing operations data for FY2022 and 2H22 were not separately reported or calculable due to business restructuring or reclassification. EOP Cash & Cash Equivalents for 2H22 is the FY2022 year-end balance.
*   **^20 EBITDA:** Annual (FY2023, FY2024) are as stated in company's Financial Highlights [AR, p.8]. Interim periods derived from Manufacturing Segment's "Segment profit/ (loss) before tax*" [Q424 Interim, p.14], defined as "After excluding finance costs, foreign exchange gain/(loss) (net) and depreciation" (proxy for EBITDA). **Note the substantial discrepancy between company-reported annual EBITDA and segment-derived figures.**
*   **^21 Cash Conversion:** Calculated as Net Cash from Operating Activities / EBITDA (Continuing Operations). OCF/EBITDA is used as a standard and meaningful measure of cash conversion.
*   **Primary Sources:** Annual Report (AR) for FY2022-FY2024; Q424 Interim Financial Statements (Q424 Interim).
*   **Calculations:** All 1H figures calculated by subtracting the corresponding 2H period from the full financial year total. Margins (EBITDA Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, Capex % of Revenue) calculated by dividing the relevant profit/cash flow metric by Revenue (Continuing Operations). Percentages rounded.
