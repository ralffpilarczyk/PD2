#### **2.3. Total Energy Consumption (GJ)**

| Period | Total Energy Consumed (GJ) |
| :------- | :--------------------------- |
| FY2024 | 119,942.0 |
| FY2023 | 118,698.7 |
| FY2022 | 123,721.0 |
| 2H2024 | Not explicitly stated (calculated total from interim report is not reliable for direct comparison with annual numbers, as annual includes all components while interim only provides a sum for certain items). Data from AR is more reliable for total. |
| 1H2024 | Not explicitly stated (same as above). |
| 2H2023 | Not explicitly stated (same as above). |
| 1H2023 | Not explicitly stated (same as above). |

*   **Most Recent Value:** 119,942.0 GJ (FY2024).
*   **Reference:** Data for FY2024, FY2023, and FY2022. FY2023 and FY2022 values are calculated as the sum of Petrol, Diesel, and Electricity consumption as reported in the source. FY2024 total includes Solar energy.
*   **Anomalies/Insights:** Total energy consumption has shown a slight fluctuating trend over the last three years. The FY2024 figure shows a slight increase from FY2023 but remains lower than FY2022, despite the inclusion of solar energy consumption (4,001.8 GJ in FY2024). This suggests improvements in energy efficiency from initiatives like replacing hydraulic machines with electric alternatives and upgrading to LED lighting.

#### **2.4. Water Consumption (MegaLiter)**

| Period | Water Consumed (MegaLiter) |
| :------- | :--------------------------- |
| FY2024 | 89.1 |
| FY2023 | 98.0 |
| FY2022 | 114.1 |

*   **Most Recent Value:** 89.1 MegaLiter (FY2024).
*   **Reference:** Data for FY2024, FY2023, and FY2022. Values restated to MegaLiter for consistency.
*   **Insights:** The Group has demonstrated a consistent decline in water consumption over the last three years, indicating successful water conservation efforts and efficient water usage practices. The 9.1% decrease from FY2023 to FY2024 is notably attributed to fewer staff residing in dormitories in one of their China facilities (FYDG). The Group's commitment includes installing water-saving taps, real-time monitoring, rainwater harvesting (FYC, CA), and wastewater recycling (FYSZ).

#### **2.5. Waste Generated (Tonne)**

| Waste Type | FY2024 (Tonne) | FY2023 (Tonne) |
| :----------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| Hazardous Waste | 56.4 | 76.0 |
| Non-Hazardous Waste (total) | 357.3 (Diverted) + 128.6 (Disposed) = 485.9 | Not available in consolidated format for FY2023 |
| **Total Waste (Hazardous + Non-Hazardous)** | 542.1 (Calculated) | Not available |

*   **Most Recent Value (Hazardous):** 56.4 tonnes (FY2024).
*   **Reference:** Data for FY2024, FY2023.
*   **Insights:** Hazardous waste reduced by 25.7% in FY2024 compared to FY2023, mainly due to the absence of large tonnage machine oil changes, which vary cyclically. Non-hazardous waste also saw reductions in FYC due to a return to normal levels after a building move in FY2023 and general efficiency improvements. However, this was offset by increases in FHM due to new mold testing and recycled material testing. The Group aims to maintain current waste levels and develop quantitative targets in the future.

#### **3.1. Total Number of Employees by Region and Gender**

| Period | Location | Male | Female | Total |
| :------- | :--------- | :----- | :------- | :------ |
| FY2024 | Singapore | 203 | 281 | 484 |
| | Malaysia | 204 | 154 | 358 |
| | China | 279 | 251 | 530 |

*   **Most Recent Value:** 1,372 employees (FY2024), with a near 1:1 male to female ratio.
*   **Reference:** Data as of 31 December 2024, 2023, 2022.
*   **Insights:** The overall workforce has decreased from 1,535 in FY2022 to 1,372 in FY2024. The proportion of employees in China has decreased significantly from 694 in FY2023 to 530 in FY2024, while Singapore (429 to 484) and Malaysia (365 to 358) have remained relatively stable or slightly increased/decreased, respectively. This aligns with the strategic shift away from China-focused operations and rationalisation of Chinese subsidiaries.

#### **3.2. New Hires and Turnover**

| Metric | Period | New Hires | Hiring Rate (%) | Turnover | Turnover Rate (%) |
| :------- | :------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| **Overall** | FY2024 | 366 | 26.7 | 342 | 24.9 |
| | FY2023 | 903 | 60.7 | 949 | 63.8 |
| | FY2022 | 883 | 57.4 | 918 | 59.7 |
| **Male New Hires** | FY2024 | 158 | 11.5 | 163 | 11.9 |
| | FY2023 | 775 | 34.5 | 515 | 34.6 |

| | FY2022 | 754 | 20.9 | 321 | 20.9 |

*   **Most Recent Values:** New hires: 366 (FY2024); Turnover: 342 (FY2024).
*   **Reference:** Data for FY2024, FY2023, FY2022.
*   **Anomalies/Insights:** Both new hires and turnover rates significantly decreased in FY2024 compared to previous years. The FY2024 employee numbers exclude outsourced workers, unlike prior periods, which impacts direct year-on-year comparison of rates (as noted by the company). The company aims to maintain a turnover rate (exclusive of temporary workers) below 30% going forward. The reduction in new hires and turnover may suggest a more stable workforce post-transformation.
*   *Source: Fu Yu 24 AR_m.md, page 49, "No. of New Hire & Hiring Rate table" and page 51, "No. of Resignations and Turnover Rate table". Note 12 on page 50 clarifies restatement of hiring rate formula and exclusion of outsourced workers for FY2024 onwards.*

#### **3.3. Employee Composition by Category (FY2024)**

| Employee Category | Male (%) | Female (%) | Total (%) | Under 30 years old (%) | 30-50 years old (%) | Over 50 years old (%) |
| :------------------ | :------- | :--------- | :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------- |
| Senior management | 80.0 | 20.0 | 100.0 | 0.0 | 45.0 | 55.0 |
